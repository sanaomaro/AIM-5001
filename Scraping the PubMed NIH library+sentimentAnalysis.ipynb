We interviewed Bernadette as part of an ongoing study of parents' experiences of school engagement during family separation and divorce. Her family circumstances and the role the children's schools played in that story merit consideration by educators, school leaders and education policy makers. Informed by theories of everyday cultural practices and sociological studies of gendered power relations in education, we argue that gender politics and organisational strategies for keeping parents 'in their place' can significantly contribute to systemic failures and school cultures that reinscribe the effects of family violence.\",\n",

Respiratory PCR samples and COVID-19 samples were taken simultaneously. Only RSV positive and COVID-19 positive infants were compared. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data were obtained from hospital electronic information system medical records. The chest radiographs at the admission were evaluated by using standard definitions for normal chest X-ray, atelectasis, bronchopenumonia, peribronchial thickening and hyperinflation in various lung volumes.\\nA total of 30 infants were enrolled in the study and RSV was identified in 20/30 infants (66%). No significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of general characteristics. Comparing to the infants with Covid-19 infections, infants with RSV infections had significantly higher rates of having oxygen support (\\nThis is the first study that compares RSV infection and COVID-19 infection. RSV infection can be more serious in the neonatal period. In cases with suspected COVID-19 infection, it should be kept in mind if atelectasis is seen on chest radiography. Respiratory failure may be more serious in RSV positive infants and RSV infection may be more dangerous for the neonatal period.\",\n",

Diagnosis may be challenging, as clinical presentation is often unspecific with only intermittent hemorrhage. Treatment of the causal pseudoaneurysm is mandatory and endovascular coil embolization is the suitable first-line management strategy. Until now there are only a very few studies about this clinical picture and its therapeutic options, especially data regarding whether additional fluid embolization is beneficial/necessary in HP is currently lacking.\\nWe report a case of a 59-year-old male patient with chronic pancreatitis and haemosuccus pancreaticus caused by a pancreatico-arterial fistula with an associated inflammatory pseudoaneurysm of the splenic artery. Initially we sought to embolize the pseudoaneurysm with microcoils. As only one coil could be safely deployed in the pseudoaneurysm we additionally employed tissue adhesive embolization in order to achieve complete occlusion of the pseudoaneurysm as well as the pancretico-arterial fistula. In the presented case inflammatory levels decreased following embolization, possibly linked to a decline in pathologic excretion of elastase and autodigestion. As not only the pseudoaneurysm but also the underlying fistula were occluded, the risk of recurrence may conceivably be reduced.\\nDiagnosis of HP is difficult and treatment of the causal pseudoaneurysm is mandatory. Endovascular embolization is the suitable first-line management strategy, complete occlusion of the fistula should be considered when possible.\",\n",

For instance, wild American crows produced alarm calls toward specifically masked humans up to 2.7 years after those humans had caught and ringed them while wearing that mask. However, individual behavior of the crows or the impact of social features on their responses, was hardly examined.

            "    \"abstract\": \"Romantic relationships are an essential element of healthy living. Although difficulties in love are encountered often, it seems that three kinds of behaviors in a romantic relationship are more susceptible to physical or psychiatric disorders: playing (sexually transmitted disease), suffering (major depressive disorder or suicide), and stalking (violence or homicide). Oxytocin plays an important role in pair-bonding. Elevated plasma oxytocin concentrations have been observed in new lovers when compared with singles. It is hypothesized that those who display these dangerous behaviors in a romantic relationship might possess specific oxytocin receptor gene aberrancy and the resultant deviant pair-bonding pattern is likely to recur in successive relationships. It is postulated that a blunted oxytocin surge might be observed in playing, whereas exaggerated oxytocin surge might be observed in suffering and stalking. The distinction between suffering and stalking might stem from the difference in their aggression tendencies. Those who suffer displays aggression toward self, while those who stalk displays aggression toward others. The exaggerated oxytocin concentrations in people who suffer and people who stalk might not be suppressed by the discouraging attitudes of their partners and might be maintained by rumination. Considering the whole-body influence of oxytocin, intranasal oxytocin application or gene therapy should be used exclusively for those who display these dangerous behaviors and not for the general population. Future research is warranted to confirm this hypothesis with analysis of modifiers such as gender.\",\n",

In addition to the impact of personality traits, the information processing of emotional stimuli also influences drivers' behaviours. Research is needed to understand how drivers interact with anger stimuli and the differences in processing anger information between safe and dangerous drivers. This study aimed to explore the differences between safe and dangerous drivers' negativity bias towards anger and discuss the causes of dangerous driving behaviours from the perspective of information processing. In total, 34 participants were divided into a safe group and dangerous group based on their traffic violation history and driving behaviour trends. Participants completed an emotional Stroop task with event-related potential (ERP) data. The results showed that the P200 amplitudes of dangerous drivers were significantly reduced compared with those of safe drivers when processing angry and neutral faces, indicating the inadequate assessment of angry faces in early emotional processing. The N170 amplitudes of dangerous drivers were significantly reduced compared with those of safe drivers when processing angry faces, demonstrating decreased negative input that is potentially related to dispositional fearlessness and uncaring traits. This study revealed negativity bias towards anger in dangerous drivers based on ERP evidence, enabling us to understand the differences in driving behaviours from the perspective of physiological mechanisms.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The outbreak of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) started in China in December 2019. COVID-19 patients at presentation show a wide spectrum of clinical and pathological involvement. We report two cases of respiratory insufficiency due to COVID-19 pneumonia that occurred in adults without a history of respiratory diseases. Although these patients improved and were discharged from the acute ward, during the hospitalization they both progressed with a subsequent clinical and radiological worsening, pointing out one of the main concerns for these patients at discharge: the possibility of developing persistent lung abnormalities also in healthy people not having other risk factors. In conclusion, these cases represent two examples of early lung fibrosis in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia with different severity disease evolution and highlight the need for long-term follow-up strategies. The etiology of this fibrosis is under discussion: we suppose that it could be due to either a possible outcome of natural history of lung damage produced by ARDS, or to the lung injury related to high oxygen level or to the lung damage directly induced by viral infection or finally to the autoimmune response. At this moment, it is not possible to predict how many people will have consequences due to COVID-19 pneumonia, and therefore we believe that careful follow-up should be mandatory.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"New psychoactive substances are being used as drugs and appear to be quite popular nowadays. Thanks to their specific properties, these drugs create inimitable experiences for intoxicated people. Synthetic cathinones are the most common compounds in these new drugs. Among them, \\u03b1-pyrrolidopentadione (\\u03b1-PVP), or \\\"Flakka\\\" (street name), is one of the most famous cathinone-designed drugs. Similar to other synthetic cathinone drugs, \\u03b1-PVP can effectively inhibit norepinephrine and dopamine transmitters. The adverse reactions of \\u03b1-PVP mainly include mania, tachycardia, and hallucinations. An increasing number of people are being admitted to emergency wards due to the consequences of their use. This work mainly summarizes the history, synthesis, pharmacology, toxicology, structure-activity relationship, metabolism, clinical process and health risks, poisoning and death, forensic toxicology, and legal status of \\u03b1-PVP. We hope this review will help bring more attention to the exploration of this substance in order to raise awareness of its negative impacts on humans.\",\n",

Echocardiograms as per routine cardiac surveillance were performed 6\\u00a0months or earlier given clinical concerns.\\nSixty-five children, 36 boys (55.4%), median (IQR) age 11.8 (5.3, 14.7) years, received HD for kidney failure with replacement therapy (KFRT). Initial modality was HD in 45 (69.2%), with CVC as initial access in 42 (93.3%) and AVF in 3 (6.7%); in the remaining 20 (30.8%) patients PD was the initial modality before switching to HD. Seven of 65 (10.8%) developed CRAT\\u00a0at median 2 (0.8, 8.4) months from CVC insertion, with one CRAT detected 3\\u00a0days following insertion. One child had 2 episodes of CRAT and one additionally thrombosed their AVF. No patient had an underlying primary kidney disease associated with a pro-thrombotic state. Those with CRAT were younger, had more frequent CVC change and received dialysis for longer duration compared to those with no CRAT. Six episodes of CRAT (75%) received anticoagulation therapy. Infective complications were observed in 25% and catheter malfunction in 50%. Five CRAT episodes (62.5%) resulted in CVC loss. One patient died after a haemorrhagic complication of anticoagulation\\u00a0and sepsis, and another developed life-threatening superior vena cava obstruction syndrome. Overall mortality\\u00a014%\\u00a0(1/7).\\nThis is the first report of CRAT in a paediatric HD population. There was ~\\u200911% incidence of CRAT in patients receiving chronic HD detected by surveillance echocardiography. Although frequently asymptomatic, CRAT is associated with serious sequelae. Anticoagulation and surveillance with expert echocardiography remain mainstays of management. Graphical abstract.\",\n",

WHO also omitted discussion of the necessity for wider employment protections to make safety and safe behavior a realistic prospect. Potential risks in outdoor work and the need to address the impact of job segregation related to inequalities in health outcomes are also absent. WHO's advice influences national practice, official guidance, and binding rules.The International Trade Union Confederation has assessed the flaws in WHO's arguments and has prepared a critique so they are understood and can be challenged.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Orthorexia Nervosa is an eating disorder that has been scarcely studied in characteristics, causes and symptoms, as well as in consequences and the relationship with other eating disorders. The present study had as its main objective the analysis of said relationship and inquisition of the possibility of predicting the development of an eating disorder from the presence of orthorexia nervosa. Also, it analyzed the differences by sex in Mexican university students.\\nThe sample consisted of 911 university students (65.4% women and 34.6% men), between an age range of 18 to 28\\u2009years old (M\\u2009=\\u200921 and SD\\u2009=\\u20091.9). Two questionnaires were responded: the ORTO14MX, a version of the ORTO-15 instrument previously validated in Mexican students, and the EDE-Q in its short version. Besides, sociodemographic data of interest was obtained and used for this study.\\nThe Pearson's correlation analysis demonstrated statistically significant relations, from mild to moderate, between the factors that make up both scales, while the linear regression analysis demonstrated that 40% of the variance is explained with the factors from the ORTO-14MX scale in the overall sample for the study. Additionally, statistically significant differences were found between men and women regarding all the subscales conforming the instruments that measured orthorexia and eating disorders.\\nThese results show a moderate predictive degree, that as promising as it is, isn't conclusive. Likewise, it was confirmed that women are still more vulnerable to develop orthorexia or another eating disorder. It can be concluded that there's a vast necessity for more studies measuring the relationship between orthorexia nervosa and eating disorders, in Latinamerican samples with diverse characteristics in sociocultural backgrounds, and clinical samples.\\nLa ortorexia nervosa es un trastorno de la conducta alimentaria que ha sido poco estudiado, tanto en sus caracter\\u00edsticas, causas y s\\u00edntomas, como en sus consecuencias y en la relaci\\u00f3n con otros trastornos de la conducta alimentaria. El presente estudio tuvo como objetivo analizar dicha relaci\\u00f3n e indagar si es posible predecir la aparici\\u00f3n de un trastorno de la conducta alimentaria a partir de la presencia de ortorexia nervosa, adem\\u00e1s de analizar diferencias por sexo en estudiantes universitarios mexicanos.\\nParticiparon en el estudio 911 estudiantes universitarios (65.4% fueron mujeres y el 34.6% hombres), en un rango de edades entre 18 y 28 a\\u00f1os (M\\u2009=\\u200921 y DE\\u2009=\\u20091.9) que respondieron dos cuestionarios que son: ORTO-14MX, una versi\\u00f3n del instrumento ORTO-15 previamente validada en estudiantes mexicanos y el EDE-Q en su versi\\u00f3n corta, adem\\u00e1s de proporcionar algunos datos sociodemogr\\u00e1ficos de inter\\u00e9s para este estudio.\\nEl an\\u00e1lisis de correlaci\\u00f3n de Pearson revel\\u00f3 relaciones estad\\u00edsticas significativas de leves a moderadas entre los factores que componen ambas escalas, mientras que el an\\u00e1lisis de regresi\\u00f3n lineal mostr\\u00f3 un que un 40% de la varianza es explicada a partir de los factores que componen la escala ORTO-14MX en la muestra de estudio. Adicionalmente se encontraron diferencias estad\\u00edsticamente significativas entre hombres y mujeres con respecto a todas las subescalas de los instrumentos que midieron ortorexia y trastornos de la conducta alimentaria.\\nEstos resultados mostraron un grado de predicci\\u00f3n moderada que s\\u00ed bien es prometedora, no resulta totalmente concluyente. Asimismo, se confirm\\u00f3 que las mujeres siguen siendo m\\u00e1s vulnerables a padecer ortorexia o un TCA. Se concluye la necesidad de continuar estudiando la relaci\\u00f3n entre la ortorexia y los TCAs, en muestras latinoamericanas con otras caracter\\u00edsticas socio demogr\\u00e1ficas y en poblaci\\u00f3n cl\\u00ednica.\",\n",

Iatrogenic vertebral artery injury is a rare but severe complication of cervical spine surgery. We aimed to evaluate dangerous vertebral artery anomalies at the CVJ in patients with BI using computed tomographic angiography (CTA).\\nCTA images of 61 BI patients were retrospectively analyzed to evaluate AVAAs and FVAAs at the CVJ. Dangerous AVAAs include a persistent first intersegmental artery (FIA), fenestration of the vertebral artery (FEN), and posterior inferior cerebellar artery with an extradural C1/2 origin (PICA-C1/2). Dangerous FVAAs include a dominant vertebral artery (DVA) and hypoplastic vertebral artery ending in the PICA (HVA-PICA) without joining the basilar artery.\\nOverall, 31 female and 30 male patients (mean age, 42.3 years) were included. The incidences of FIA, FEN, and PICA-C1/2 were 29.5 % (18/61), 3.3 % (2/61), and 3.3 % (2/61), respectively, whereas the incidences of DVA and HVA-PICA were 36.1 % (22/61) and 1.65 % (1/61), respectively.\\nDangerous vertebral artery anomalies at the CVJ have a high incidence in patients with BI. Preoperative CTA is highly recommended in such patients to identify anomalous vertebral arteries and reduce the risk of intraoperative injury.\",\n",

The importance of such a dimension lies in the possibility of predicting the associated nature of damages without imposing any unrealistic simplifications or restrictions. To provide the best possible modeling framework, several implementations are tested using logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, support vector machine, naive Bayes classifier and random forests to forecast the occurrence of the human, environmental and material consequences of industrial accidents based on the EU Major Accident Reporting System's records. Many performance metrics are estimated to select the most suitable model in each treated case. The obtained results show the distinctive ability of random forests and neural networks to predict the occurrence of specific consequences of accidents in the industrial installations, with an obvious exception concerning the performance of this latter algorithm when the involved datasets are highly unbalanced.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Aggressive and cannibalistic female spiders can impose strong selection on male mating and fertilization strategies. Furthermore, the distinctive reproductive morphology of spiders is predicted to influence the outcome of sperm competition. Polyandry is common in spiders, leading to defensive male strategies that include guarding, plugging and self-sacrifice. Paternity patterns are highly variable and unlikely to be determined solely by mating order, but rather by relative copulation duration, deployment of plugs and cryptic female choice. The ability to strategically allocate sperm is limited, either by the need to refill pedipalps periodically or owing to permanent sperm depletion after mating. Further insights now rely on unravelling several proximate mechanisms such as the process of sperm activation and the role of seminal fluids. This article is part of the theme issue 'Fifty years of sperm competition'.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Recent popular press authors have proposed that men are less likely to wear face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate this notion in the current article by analyzing three extant datasets. We also assess the mediating effect of eight different face mask perceptions in the relation between gender and face mask wearing via the Face Mask Perceptions Scale. Across the three datasets, the sample-size weighted meta-analytic correlation between gender and face mask wearing was not statistically significant, and no face mask perception was a consistent mediator of this effect. Gender did have significant relations with two face mask perceptions, however. Men were more likely to perceive face masks as infringing on their independence, whereas women were more likely to perceive face masks as uncomfortable. Therefore, although gender does not relate to whether a person wears a face mask, it does relate to face mask perceptions. We offer several suggestions for research and practice from these results, such as the positioning of face mask wearing alongside passive health behaviors, the broader study of face mask perceptions' outcomes beyond face mask wearing, as well as the creation of interventions to target differing face mask perceptions across genders.\",\n",

This article examines the role of Western Australia's legislation in reinforcing stigma and discrimination of sex workers. It draws on stigma and discrimination-specific results from open-ended survey responses and interview data collected as part of a larger cross-sectional mixed-methods study. Experiences and/or anticipation of stigma and discrimination resulted in some sex workers concealing their involvement in sex work from family, friends and their home communities. This was a major barrier to accessing health care and protective services and impacted negatively on their mental health and wellbeing. There is a need for policy change and support to shift society's perception of sex work to that of a legitimate occupation to decrease sex workers' experiences of stigma and discrimination and improve their access to and utilisation of health care and protective services. These findings highlight the need for the decriminalisation of the Western Australian sex industry and the development of training programmes for police and healthcare workers to reduce the stigma and discrimination experienced by sex workers in these settings.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The crosstalk between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key determinant of cancer metastasis. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), one of the main cellular components of TME, promote cancer cell invasion and dissemination through mechanisms including cell-cell interactions and the paracrine secretion of growth factors, cytokines and chemokines. During metastasis, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are shed from the primary tumor to the bloodstream, where they can be detected as single cells or clusters. The current knowledge about the biology of CTC clusters positions them as key actors in metastasis formation. It also indicates that CTCs do not act alone and that they may be aided by stromal and immune cells, which seem to shape their metastatic potential. Among these cells, CAFs are found associated with CTCs in heterotypic CTC clusters, and their presence seems to increase their metastatic efficiency. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge on the role that CAFs play on metastasis and we discuss their implication on the biogenesis, metastasis-initiating capacity of CTC clusters, and clinical implications. Moreover, we speculate about possible therapeutic strategies aimed to limit the metastatic potential of CTC clusters involving the targeting of CAFs as well as their difficulties and limitations.\",\n",

Frequency of BD and the use of obstetric emergency services was observed.\\nA direct relationship was observed between the pandemic and a decrease in BD. Although emergency obstetric visits decreased, the frequency of deliveries and cases of PPH remained unchanged. After applying strategies to promote voluntary BD, a very slight increase was observed in the frequency of BD, with a negative indicator persisting between donation and blood demand.\\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to shortages at BBs. In this context, typical measures to encourage an altruistic attitude toward BD have not had a significant impact. As causes of PPH continue, quality of care may be affected by the current situation at BBs. Governments and institutions must implement new strategies to motivate BD.\",\n",

Awareness of this phenomenon can help avoid unnecessary surgical intervention and the potential associated morbidities.\\nA 76 year old man presented to hospital with dyspnoea and productive cough and was diagnosed with an infective exacerbation of COPD. He subsequently had a CTPA which showed a significant amount of free intraperitoneal gas in the upper abdomen. He was completely asymptomatic from this with no abdominal pain, distension, or significant rise in inflammatory markers. Of note, he had never had previous abdominal surgery or endoscopic procedures. He showed no signs of peritonism and was closely observed with serial abdominal examinations for 24 h. He subsequently tolerated oral intake and was discharged 8 days after admission.\\nSpontaneous pneumoperitoneum can be due to a variety of intrathoracic, gynaecologic, intra-abdominal and iatrogenic causes. This is a rare case of asymptomatic idiopathic pneumoperitoneum where no clear aetiology or risk factors were found for his free intraperitoneal gas. To the best of our knowledge there have only been two published case reports in the English literature describing idiopathic pneumoperitoneum in a patient that was completely asymptomatic from it.\\nAs a general surgeon it is important to be aware of the non-surgical causes of pneumoperitoneum. Knowledge of this uncommon condition may help reduce the risk of unnecessary laparotomy.\",\n",

As colchicine is a substrate for CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), drug-drug interactions are important factors that cause fatal colchicine-related side effects. Thus, we conducted a nation-wide survey to determine the status of inappropriate colchicine prescriptions in Japan. Patients prescribed the regular use of colchicine from April 2014 to March 2017 were identified using the Japanese large health insurance claims database. As the primary endpoint, we evaluated the concomitant prescription proportions of strong CYP3A4 and/or P-gp inhibitors classified as \\\"contraindications for co-administration\\\" with colchicine in patients with renal or liver impairment. We defined these cases as \\\"inappropriate colchicine prescriptions.\\\" Additionally, factors affecting inappropriate colchicine prescriptions were analyzed. Among the 3302 enrolled patients, 43 (1.30%) were inappropriately prescribed colchicine. Of these 43 patients, 11 had baseline renal and/or liver impairment. By multiple regression analysis, the primary diseases \\\"gout\\\" and \\\"Beh\\u00e7et's disease\\\" were extracted as independent factors for inappropriate colchicine prescriptions with odds ratios of 0.40 (95% confidence interval: 0.19-0.84) and 4.93 (95% confidence interval: 2.12-11.5), respectively. We found that approximately 1% of patients had important colchicine interactions. Particularly, Beh\\u00e7et's disease was a risk factor for inappropriate prescriptions, with approximately 25% of patients showing renal and/or liver impairment (classified as \\\"contraindications for co-administration\\\"). These findings may be useful for medical professionals who prescribe colchicine therapy.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"In 2015, Jamaica became the first Caribbean country to decriminalise personal cannabis possession, legalise home cultivation and establish a commercial therapeutic cannabis market via the passage of the Dangerous Drugs Amendment Act (DDAA).\\nTo critically analyse implementation of the legal therapeutic cannabis market under the DDAA.\\nSynthesis of findings from semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 22 key informants (KIs) from the government, industry, academia and NGO sector, unstructured interviews with illegal growers, and field observations of licensed and illegal operators.\\nKIs identified a number of challenges in implementing therapeutic market provisions under DDAA, including a limited buy-in from key government agencies; delays in developing a framework for quality assurance; and lack of access to banking services. Public sector actors stressed the challenges imposed by the UN drug conventions and need to maintain favourable diplomatic relationship with the US federal government, with the consequence of prioritising enforcement to prevent diversion and inversion. Implementation of the Alternative Development Programme in two traditional cannabis-growing communities experienced challenges with land titles and frictions in local communities. High compliance costs and limited skills to meet the envisioned medical standards presented barriers for traditional farmers. Many KIs conceptualised the purchasing of cannabis from the regulated market as \\\"recreational\\\" rather than medical, reflecting the marketing and limited information on medical applications at point of sale. Licensees' reliance on foreign investment puts local industry at risk of predatory shareholder agreements, but also provides needed investment and expertise.\\nExternal international factors (e.g. UN treaties, correspondent banking with the US) and conflicting domestic government agency visions for the reform played a significant role in the DDAA implementation. As cannabis law reform spreads beyond Western jurisdictions, consideration of pre-existing social, cultural and economic conditions of developing countries will be important.\",\n",

Public sector actors stressed the challenges imposed by the UN drug conventions and need to maintain favourable diplomatic relationship with the US federal government, with the consequence of prioritising enforcement to prevent diversion and inversion. Implementation of the Alternative Development Programme in two traditional cannabis-growing communities experienced challenges with land titles and frictions in local communities. High compliance costs and limited skills to meet the envisioned medical standards presented barriers for traditional farmers. Many KIs conceptualised the purchasing of cannabis from the regulated market as \\\"recreational\\\" rather than medical, reflecting the marketing and limited information on medical applications at point of sale. Licensees' reliance on foreign investment puts local industry at risk of predatory shareholder agreements, but also provides needed investment and expertise.\",\n",

However, many have deemed it unnecessary and overused with reported negligence on patients' basic needs during its implementation. Studies have shown that having empathy and non-judgmental attitudes are vital in reducing and eliminating the use of restraint.\\nTo explore whether experiential learning will improve empathy and confidence, among nursing and medical students when managing dangerous, aggressive, and violent patients.\\nA pre- and post-test, same group quasi-experimental design was used to explore the effectiveness of using the Empathetic CAre and REsponse (ECARE), an experiential learning session to equip nursing and medical students on managing dangerous, aggressive, and violent patients. Outcome measures include students' confidence when using verbal de-escalation, physical and chemical restraint techniques. Empathy scores were also compared.\\nA University offering both medical and nursing program from undergraduate to postgraduate level.\\n249 nursing and 50 medical students undergoing the mental health nursing module in Year 2 of their nursing program and psychiatry rotation in Year 3 of their medical education.\\nResults showed that, for both student populations, the empathy and confidence scores significantly improved after attending ECARE. ANCOVA conducted on the post-intervention Jefferson empathy score between the populations with an adjusted baseline score revealed a statistically significant adjusted mean difference between them.\\nThis study demonstrated that experiential learning could improve the learners' empathy through the integration of hands-on learning. This in turn could enhance future healthcare professionals' care quality. Experiential learning opportunities should be incorporated into existing pedagogies as this helps to improve students' confidence in managing dangerous, aggressive and violent patients, reducing the use of physical restraint, thereby enhancing the quality of patient care.\",\n",

With an array of virulence factors, those parasites modify host macrophage signaling and functions. Depending of the species involved, visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis will develop. Several years ago, Leishmania Viannia guyanensis that is naturally infected with the endosymbiotic virus Leishmania RNA Virus 1 was found to cause a particularly aggressive form of South-American mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. This virus, when co-transmitted with the parasite was shown to strongly modulate RNA sensors and NLRP3 inflammasome network that could explain in part the exacerbated skin pathology caused by this particular parasite. In this review, we will be discussing how this endosymbiotic virus-infected Leishmania in conjunction with Leishmania exosomes partner together to manipulate host immune response in their favor.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Dangerous practices and games at school. Three separate categories of dangerous games can be distinguished. The non-oxygenating or fainting games, which consist of mechanical compressions or strangulative mechanisms. These are performed in the search of pseudo-hallucinogenic sensations. There are several such games: from the simple but non-the-less dangerous \\\"tomato game\\\", performed by younger children (from 3-4 years of age), to the \\\"choking game\\\", between 7 and 14 years of age. \\\"Aggressive\\\" or \\\"violent\\\" games which use physical and psychological violence from a group of people towards a single individual. Acute neurological complications can be the consequence of such games, and their degree depends on the duration and intensity of the strangulation. These can vary from cerebral edema, loss of consciousness, long term cerebral damage (deafness, blindness, bedridden), irreversible coma and death. Physical consequences of aggressive games are equally important, such as vertebral fractures, cranial trauma, organ rupture. Victims of violence present repeated psycho-traumatic manifestations. Preventive messages associate information on the risks of such games with civic education (listening, solidarity and trust in others), the development of psychological and social skills, an active involvement in school-life and concrete responsibility taking. Early identification of symptoms of these practices by family members and professionals helps to avoid their repetition and increased danger, even addictive patterns.\\nPratiques et jeux dangereux en milieu scolaire. Les pratiques dangereuses en cour d\\u2019\\u00e9cole sont multiples. Les jeux dits de non-oxyg\\u00e9nation ou d\\u2019\\u00e9vanouissement consistent, par un m\\u00e9canisme de compression ou de strangulation, \\u00e0 rechercher certaines sensations pseudo-hallucinatoires. Les jeux dits d\\u2019agression ou jeux violents utilisent la violence physique ou psychologique de mani\\u00e8re gratuite d\\u2019un groupe de jeunes envers une personne seule. Leur caract\\u00e8re r\\u00e9p\\u00e9titif dans le temps d\\u00e9finit le harc\\u00e8lement. La dur\\u00e9e et l\\u2019intensit\\u00e9 de la strangulation peuvent induire des complications neurologiques aigu\\u00ebs (oed\\u00e8me c\\u00e9r\\u00e9bral, perte de connaissance prolong\\u00e9e), des l\\u00e9sions c\\u00e9r\\u00e9brales d\\u00e9finitives (surdit\\u00e9, c\\u00e9cit\\u00e9, \\u00e9tat grabataire), un coma irr\\u00e9versible, le d\\u00e9c\\u00e8s. Les cons\\u00e9quences physiques des jeux d\\u2019agression sont tr\\u00e8s lourdes : fractures de la colonne vert\\u00e9brale, traumatismes cr\\u00e2niens, ruptures d\\u2019organes. Les enfants victimes ont des manifestations psychotraumatiques r\\u00e9p\\u00e9t\\u00e9es. Les messages de pr\\u00e9vention associent, outre une information sur les risques, une \\u00e9ducation \\u00e0 la citoyennet\\u00e9 (\\u00e9coute, coh\\u00e9sion, solidarit\\u00e9, confiance en l\\u2019autre), le d\\u00e9veloppement de comp\\u00e9tences psychologiques et sociales de l\\u2019enfant, une implication active du jeune dans la vie scolaire et la prise de responsabilit\\u00e9s concr\\u00e8tes. Le rep\\u00e9rage par les familles et les professionnels de sympt\\u00f4mes chroniques \\u00e9vocateurs de ces pratiques permet d\\u2019\\u00e9viter leur r\\u00e9p\\u00e9tition et leur dangerosit\\u00e9 encore accrue, voire un passage \\u00e0 l\\u2019addiction.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The face of a friend indicates safety, the face of a foe can indicate threat. Here, we examine the effects of verbal instructions ('beware of this person') on the perception of unknown persons. Focusing on visual attention, face identity and facial expression information is examined during instructed threat-of-shock or safety. However, shocks never occurred. Participants quickly acquired instructed threat associations, and electrocortical processing differentiated threat- from safe-identities as well as emotional and neutral facial expressions. Importantly, face encoding varied as a joint function of identity and facial expression, as revealed by pronounced N170 amplitudes to smiling threat-identities. Moreover, instructions readily reversed previously learned affective associations leading to attention allocation and memory updating as reflected by N170, EPN and P3 amplitudes toward new threat-identities displaying angry expressions. These findings demonstrate that person perception flexibly re-adjusts according to minimal information. Intriguingly, perceptual biases occur even though the anticipated aversive consequence does not occur, with implications for research on stereotyping and anxious psychopathology.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Bivalve molluscs can acquire marine biotoxins by filter-feeding upon certain toxin-producing microalgae. The two most common syndromes observed in temperate coastal waters have been diarrhetic shellfish poisoning (DSP) and paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP). While DSP is a non-fatal gastrointestinal syndrome, PSP is a neurological syndrome which can lead to death by respiratory paralysis in high intoxication scenarios. In Portugal, the presence of both DSP and PSP toxins leads to recurrent seasonal bans of bivalve harvesting. On a few occasions, the bans were not placed in time, not properly disseminated to the public or were disregarded by recreational harvesters. Several cases of poisonings have been studied in collaboration between health authorities and the laboratory in charge of the biotoxin monitoring programme. Some of the outbreaks have even called the attention of the local media. In several of these recorded cases, a common trait has emerged throughout the years: bivalve harvest had often been done during very low tides attributed to either new or full moons. These tides expose intertidal bivalves more widely, increase harvesting time, and allow picking of larger-sized specimens. In some occasions, the consumers were extremely unfortunate because a noxious coincidence had occurred: larger-sized specimens were available but had attained the highest toxin content of the toxic season. This review alerts that despite costly monitoring programmes have been perfected through the years, human poisonings still take place due to the rapid increase in toxin levels and/or disrespect of harvest bans.\",\n",

Statins are one of the commonly prescribed medicines worldwide that are generally well tolerated. Muscle-related symptoms have a varied clinical presentation which usually increases if a new medicine is co-prescribed. We report the case of a 65- year-old woman who presented with a 10-day history of extreme fatigue, slowly progressing muscle weakness and insomnia. Drug-induced myopathy was diagnosed with concomitant use of atorvastatin and ciprofloxacin. Muscle weakness improved after the medicines were withdrawn. Co-prescription of Ciprofloxacin and statin therapy appeared to have contributed to muscle weakness in this patient. Drug interaction should also be kept in mind, when managing patients on statins as it may be underappreciated as a cause of muscle weakness and its consequences can have potentially serious outcomes.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Optimal prehospital management and treatment of patients with accidental hypothermia is a matter of frequent debate, with controversies usually revolving around the subject of rewarming. The rule of thumb in primary emergency care and first aid for patients with accidental hypothermia has traditionally been to be refrain from prehospital active rewarming and to focus on preventing further heat loss. The potential danger of active external rewarming in a prehospital setting has previously been generally accepted among the emergency medicine community based on a fear of potential complications, such as \\\"afterdrop\\\", \\\"rewarming syndrome\\\", and \\\"circum-rescue collapse\\\". This has led to a reluctancy from health care providers to provide patients with active external rewarming outside the hospital. Different theories and hypotheses exist for these physiological phenomena, but the scientific evidence is limited. The research question is whether the prehospital use of active external rewarming is dangerous for patients with accidental hypothermia. This systematic review intends to describe the acute unfavourable adverse effects of active external rewarming on patients with accidental hypothermia.\\nA literature search of the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL], and SveMed+ was carried out, and all articles were screened for eligibility. All article formats were included.\\nTwo thousand three hundred two articles were screened, and eight articles met our search criteria. Three articles were case reports or case series, one was a prospective study, two were retrospective studies, one article was a literature review, and one article was a war report from the Napoleonic Wars.\\nOne of the main findings in this article was the poor scientific quality and the low number of articles meeting our inclusion criteria. When conducting this review, we found no scientific evidence of acceptable quality to prove that the use of active external rewarming is dangerous for patients with accidental hypothermia in a prehospital setting. We found several articles claiming that active external rewarming is dangerous, but most of them do not cite references or provide evidence.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Besides advanced age and the presence of multiple comorbidities as major contributors to increased risk of severe disease and fatal outcome from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease (COVID-19), there is now emerging evidence that overweight and obesity predispose to severe symptoms and negative prognosis. Remarkably, the severity of COVID-19 appears to rise with increasing body mass index (BMI). The association between COVID-19 outcomes and overweight/obesity has biological and physiological plausibility. Potential pathophysiological mechanisms that may explain this strong association include the chronic pro-inflammatory state, the excessive oxidative stress response, and the impaired immunity that is commonly reported in these individuals. The role of cytokines, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and altered natural killer cell polarization in the dangerous liaison between COVID-19 and obesity are discussed here. These pathways can favor and accelerate the deleterious downstream cellular effects of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, obesity is well known to be associated with reduced lung function and poor response to mechanical ventilation, thus placing these individuals at high risk of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19. Furthermore, obesity may lead to other complications, such as renal failure, cardiovascular dysfunction, hypertension, and vascular damage, which in turn can further accelerate negative clinical outcomes from COVID-19. Obese individuals should be shielded against any potential viral exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with consequential considerations for compulsory protection devices and social distancing. Health care providers should be aware that obesity predisposes to severe symptoms and negative prognosis in COVID-19 patients.\",\n",

Most authors recognize the fundamental role of trochlear dysplasia in the genesis of patellar dislocation, and some strongly defend correcting the abnormality, yet others find it too dangerous or unnecessary. Misunderstanding or undervaluation of trochlear dysplasia leads to inappropriate or failed patellofemoral (PF) surgery, the iatrogenic complications of which are well known. Many surgeons miss a key aspect of trochlear dysplasia: the overhang or the prominence of the trochlea relative to the anterior femoral cortex, characterized by a supra-trochlear spur. Trochleoplasty should not be performed as a secondary or revision procedure, but as a primary procedure with clear indications, and the key to improved outcomes is to ensure the right indication for each patient, which can only be determined by understanding the extent of dysplasia in both the axial and sagittal planes.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Amid efforts to care for the large number of patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19), there has been considerable speculation about whether the lung injury seen in these patients is different than acute respiratory distress syndrome from other causes. One idea that has garnered considerable attention, particularly on social media and in free open-access medicine, is the notion that lung injury due to COVID-19 is more similar to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). Drawing on this concept, it has also been proposed that treatments typically employed in the management of HAPE and other forms of acute altitude illness-pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide-should be considered for COVID-19. Despite some similarities in clinical features between the two entities, such as hypoxemia, radiographic opacities, and altered lung compliance, the pathophysiological mechanisms of HAPE and lung injury due to COVID-19 are fundamentally different, and the entities cannot be viewed as equivalent. Although of high utility in the management of HAPE and acute mountain sickness, systemically delivered pulmonary vasodilators and acetazolamide should not be used in the treatment of COVID-19, as they carry the risk of multiple adverse consequences, including worsened ventilation-perfusion matching, impaired carbon dioxide transport, systemic hypotension, and increased work of breathing.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"A common biologic property of the gammaherpesviruses Epstein-Barr Virus and Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus is their use of B lymphocytes as a reservoir of latency in healthy individuals that can undergo oncogenic transformation later in life. Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) employ an impressive arsenal of proteins and non-coding RNAs to reprogram lymphocytes for proliferative expansion. Within lymphoid tissues, the germinal center (GC) reaction is a hub of B cell proliferation and death. The goal of a GC is to generate and then select for a pool of immunoglobulin (Ig) genes that will provide a protective humoral adaptive immune response. B cells infected with GHVs are detected in GCs and bear the hallmark signatures of the mutagenic processes of somatic hypermutation and isotype class switching of the Ig genes. However, data also supports extrafollicular B cells as a reservoir engaged by GHVs. Next-generation sequencing technologies provide unprecedented detail of the Ig sequence that informs the natural history of infection at the single cell level. Here, we review recent reports from human and murine GHV systems that identify striking differences in the immunoglobulin repertoire of infected B cells compared to their uninfected counterparts. Implications for virus biology, GHV-associated cancers, and host immune dysfunction will be discussed.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The co-existence of humans and gut microbiota started millions of years ago. Until now, a balance gradually developed between gut bacteria and their hosts. It is now recognized that gut microbiota are key to form adequate immune and metabolic functions and, more in general, for the maintenance of good health. Gut microbiota are established before birth under the influence of maternal nutrition and metabolic status, which can impact the future metabolic risk of the offspring in terms of obesity, diabetes, and cardiometabolic disorders during the lifespan. Obesity and diabetes are prone to disrupt the gut microbiota and alter the gut barrier permeability, leading to metabolic endotoxaemia with its detrimental consequences on health. Specific bacterial sequences are now viewed as peculiar signatures of the metabolic syndrome across life stages in each individual, and are linked to pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) via metabolic products (metabolites) and immune modulation. These mechanisms have been linked, in association with abnormalities in microbial richness and diversity, to an increased risk of developing arterial hypertension, systemic inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. Emerging strategies for the manipulation of intestinal microbiota represent a promising therapeutic option for the prevention and treatment of CVD especially in individuals prone to CV events.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Extreme Risk Protection Order (ERPO) laws are a promising gun violence prevention strategy. ERPO laws allow specific categories of people (law enforcement in all states, family in most) to petition a court to request that an individual be temporarily prohibited from purchasing and possessing firearms because that individual is behaving dangerously and at risk of violence, either to themselves or others. In 2017 Washington\\u00a0State's ERPO law took effect. King County developed a comprehensive approach to implementing\\u00a0the ERPO\\u00a0law. The early experience of King County offers important insight into how early adopters of these laws are incorporating EPROs into their approach to gun violence prevention.\\nWe systematically reviewed, abstracted and coded data from every ERPO petition filed in King County in 2017 and 2018, and all ERPO court records associated with those petitions. We conducted descriptive analyses of the coded data.\\nSeventy-five ERPO petitions were filed in King County during the study period. Judges granted a temporary ERPO in all 75 cases; 65 (87%) of these cases resulted in a one-year ERPO. Law enforcement initiated 73 (97%) of these petitions, and family members filed the remaining two. The 75 petitions filed described respondents' risk as to \\\"themselves only\\\" in 30 cases (40%), to \\\"others only\\\" in 20 cases (27%) and \\\"to themselves and others\\\" in 25 cases (33%). Five cases where the threat was to \\\"others only\\\" met a definition of mass shooting threat. For 95% of the temporary ERPOs issued, the courts' reasoning for issuing ERPOs included either current violence or brandishing a firearm. Court records for the 75 cases detail firearms removed and/or include receipts for removed firearms in 61 cases (81%) either as part of ERPO precipitating events (n = 13, 17%) or in conjunction with ERPO service (n = 48, 64%).\\nThese findings suggest that Washington's ERPO law is being applied when someone is threatening violence\\u00a0to self or others, or brandishing a gun and at least one other risk factor is present. The early experience of King County provides insight into how this law is being implemented in one jurisdiction and how courts are evaluating such cases.\",\n",

The 75 petitions filed described respondents' risk as to \\\"themselves only\\\" in 30 cases (40%), to \\\"others only\\\" in 20 cases (27%) and \\\"to themselves and others\\\" in 25 cases (33%). Five cases where the threat was to \\\"others only\\\" met a definition of mass shooting threat. For 95% of the temporary ERPOs issued, the courts' reasoning for issuing ERPOs included either current violence or brandishing a firearm. Court records for the 75 cases detail firearms removed and/or include receipts for removed firearms in 61 cases (81%) either as part of ERPO precipitating events (n = 13, 17%) or in conjunction with ERPO service (n = 48, 64%).\",\n",

The main aim of the study was to verify the macromolecular substances' anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reaction in guinea pigs and establish a size-exclusive chromatographic method to detect them. The macromolecular substances from six TCMIs (Danshen injection, Dengzhanxixin injection, Honghua injection, Qingkailing injection, Shuanghuanglian injection and Shuxuening injection) were prepared by removing substances with molecular weight less than 10\\u00a0kDa with an ultra-filter. The anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions caused by original TCMIs, injections rich in or free of macromolecules were assayed in guinea pigs. The relationship between the amount of the macromolecular substances and peak area of chromatogram was established by size-exclusive chromatography. Injections free of macromolecules were not likely to cause anaphylactic and anaphylactoid reactions, but injections rich in macromolecular substances were more likely to do so. If the macromolecular substances with molecular weight bigger than 10\\u00a0kDa were removed, the signal of macromolecular substances in TCMIs was quantitatively reduced. All the results suggested that macromolecular substances in TCMIs are a dangerous factor causing safety problems, and the macromolecular substances can be quantitatively detected with size-exclusive chromatography.\",\n",

Long-lasting concomitant use of flucloxacillin and acetaminophen can lead to 5-oxoproline accumulation and severe high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Females and patients with sepsis, impaired kidney and/or liver function, malnutrition, advanced age, congenital 5-oxoprolinase deficiency and supratherapeutic acetaminophen and flucloxacillin dosage are associated with increased risk. Therefore, a critical attitude towards the prescription of acetaminophen concomitant with flucloxacillin in these patients is needed. We present the case of a 79-year-old woman with severe 5-oxoprolinaemia after long-lasting treatment with flucloxacillin and acetaminophen, explaining the toxicological mechanism and risk factors, and we make recommendations for acetaminophen use in patients with long-lasting flucloxacillin treatment.\\nAlthough rare, long-lasting treatment with flucloxacillin concomitant with acetaminophen can lead to severe high anion gap metabolic acidosis.When prescribing long-lasting flucloxacillin therapy in combination with acetaminophen, regular blood gas analysis is needed to evaluate pH and the anion gap.In cases of 5-oxoproline-induced high anion gap metabolic acidosis in patients with long-lasting acetaminophen and flucloxacillin therapy, acetaminophen prescription should be stopped immediately. Replacing flucloxacillin with another antibiotic agent should be considered.\",\n",

Lithium concentrates into principal cells in collecting ducts in the kidney and downregulates aquaporin 2 expression, which reduces renal reabsorption of water. This disease is characterized by polyuria - polydipsia leading to intracellular dehydration and hypernatremia. Water deprivation test is performed to confirm insipidus diabetes. The desmopressin permits to distinguish nephrogenic from cranial insipidus diabetes. We report the case of a 64 years old women who presented with global dehydration and severe hypernatremia. Four years ago, she was hospitalized for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus related to a self-induced lithium intoxication. Persistent nephrogenic insipidus diabetes after cessation of lithium therapy are described in literature, and this hypothesis may be consistent with this case report.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"During an epidemic with a new virus, we depend on modelling to plan the response: but how good are the data? The aim of our work was to better understand the impact of misclassification errors in identification of true cases of COVID-19 on epidemic curves. Data originated from Alberta, Canada (available on 28 May 2020). There is presently no information of sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) of laboratory tests used in Canada for the causal agent for COVID-19. Therefore, we examined best attainable performance in other jurisdictions and similar viruses. This suggested perfect Sp and Sn 60-95%. We used these values to re-calculate epidemic curves to visualize the potential bias due to imperfect testing. If the sensitivity improved, the observed and adjusted epidemic curves likely fall within 95% confidence intervals of the observed counts. However, bias in shape and peak of the epidemic curves can be pronounced, if sensitivity either degrades or remains poor in the 60-70% range. These issues are minor early in the epidemic, but hundreds of undiagnosed cases are likely later on. It is therefore hazardous to judge progress of the epidemic based on observed epidemic curves unless quality of testing is better understood.\\nAu cours d\\u2019une \\u00e9pid\\u00e9mie caus\\u00e9e par un nouveau virus nous d\\u00e9pendons de la mod\\u00e9lisation pour \\u00e9tablir un plan de gestion de la situation : mais les donn\\u00e9es sont-elles de bonne qualit\\u00e9? Le but de ce travail \\u00e9tait de mieux comprendre l\\u2019impact que les erreurs de classement du virus COVID-19 ont sur les courbes qui d\\u00e9crivent l\\u2019\\u00e9pid\\u00e9mie. Les donn\\u00e9es proviennent de l\\u2019Alberta, au Canada (dat\\u00e9es du 28 mai, 2020). Il n\\u2019y a actuellement pas d\\u2019information sur la sensibilit\\u00e9 (Sn) et sur la sp\\u00e9cificit\\u00e9 (Sp) des tests de d\\u00e9pistage de la COVID-19 utilis\\u00e9s en laboratoire au Canada. De ce fait, nous avons examin\\u00e9 la performance optimale observ\\u00e9e dans d\\u2019autres juridictions et pour d\\u2019autres virus semblables. Ceci a men\\u00e9 \\u00e0 une sp\\u00e9cificit\\u00e9 parfaite et une sensibilit\\u00e9 de 60-95%. Nous avons donc utilis\\u00e9 ces valeurs pour refaire le calcul des courbes \\u00e9pid\\u00e9miques afin de visualiser les risques potentiels de biais dus au testage moins que parfait. Si la sensibilit\\u00e9 s\\u2019am\\u00e9liore, les courbes \\u00e9pid\\u00e9miques ajust\\u00e9es et celles observ\\u00e9es seront probablement incluses dans les intervalles de confiance (95%) entourant le nombre observ\\u00e9 de cas. N\\u00e9anmoins, la forme et le sommet des courbes \\u00e9pid\\u00e9miques peuvent \\u00eatre biais\\u00e9es de fa\\u00e7on consid\\u00e9rable si la sensibilit\\u00e9 se d\\u00e9grade ou si elle se tient aux alentours de 60-70%. Ce probl\\u00e8me n\\u2019est pas un probl\\u00e8me majeur au tout d\\u00e9but d\\u2019une \\u00e9pid\\u00e9mie mais peut le devenir apr\\u00e8s un certain temps. Il est donc risqu\\u00e9 de porter jugement sur le progr\\u00e8s de la propagation du virus en se fiant sur les courbes \\u00e9pid\\u00e9miques \\u00e0 moins que la qualit\\u00e9 et la fiabilit\\u00e9 des m\\u00e9thodes de d\\u00e9pistage soient bien connues.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"We are continuously exposed to large numbers of non-biological, persistent particulates through dermal, oral and inhalation routes. At sizes perfect for cell interactions, such modern particle exposures are derived from human engineering either purposefully (e.g. additives/excipients) or inadvertently (e.g. pollution). Whether oral or dermal exposure to common particles has significantly adverse effects is not yet known. However, relationships between increased morbidity or mortality and airborne particle exposure are well established. Large nanoparticles and microparticles adsorb environmental molecules, including antigens and allergens, and deliver them to cells potentially with an adjuvant effect. Smaller nanoparticles may have enhanced redox activity due to increased surface areas or band gap effects. Under some circumstances, ultrasmall nanoparticles can ligate cellular receptors or interact with other cell machinery and drive distinct cell signalling. These, as well as the potential for inflammasome activation, are discussed as feasible pathways to understanding or de-bunking particle toxicity.\",\n",

Problems and specificity of anaesthesia in the elderly becomes a particularly important issue in this context. Spinal anesthesia is a method often used to anesthetize elderly patients, and hypotension is one of its most common early complications. Untreated or improperly treated hypotension increases the risk of perioperative complications such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke or acute renal failure. The prevention of hypotension consists of intravenous fluid therapy and pre-emptive use of vasoconstrictor drugs. Among vasoconstrictors, ephedrine and phenylephrine are commonly used to treat hypotension due to spinal anaesthesia. Both drugs are available in Poland. Issues related to their use in the treatment of hypotension caused by spinal anaesthesia in the elderly, including the features of both drugs, their method of administration and dosage based on the literature and own experience are the subject of this study. It should be noted, however, that most studies in the use of ephedrine and phenylephrine as a targeted treatment for hypotension concern the obstetric patient population while the elderly population is underrepresented and the results are inconclusive.\",\n",

This study addresses this need by analyzing in-depth, geo-narrative interviews conducted with 15 youth (60% Black, 27% Latinx, 53% female, 14 to 17\\u00a0years old) residing in low-income, high-crime Chicago neighborhoods to explore youths' perceptions of safety and strategies for navigating neighborhood space. After carrying geographical positioning system (GPS) trackers for an eight-day period, youths' travel patterns were mapped, and these maps were used as part of an interview with youth that explored daily routines, with special consideration paid to where and when youth felt safe. Drawing on activity settings theory and exploring youth voice, we find that experiences of community violence are commonplace, but youth describe how they have safe spaces that are embedded within these dangerous contexts. Perceptions of safety and danger were related to environmental, social, and temporal cues. Youth reported four overarching safety strategies, including avoidance, hypervigilance, self-defense, and emotional management, but these strategies considerably varied by gender. We discuss implications for practice and future directions of research. HIGHLIGHTS: This study explored Chicago youths' safety strategies and resilience in high-crime neighborhoods. Safe and dangerous spaces are embedded or overlapping settings. All youth practiced safety strategies but they considerably varied by gender. Perceptions are intersubjectively created due to the codes, rules, and norms of community life. Violence is common and extreme in everyday life of this sample of Chicago adolescents.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Chromosomal instability (CIN) is associated with many human diseases, including neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative conditions, age-related disorders and cancer, and is a key driver for disease initiation and progression. A major source of structural chromosome instability (s-CIN) leading to structural chromosome aberrations is \\\"replication stress\\\", a condition in which stalled or slowly progressing replication forks interfere with timely and error-free completion of the S phase. On the other hand, mitotic errors that result in chromosome mis-segregation are the cause of numerical chromosome instability (n-CIN) and aneuploidy. In this review, we will discuss recent evidence showing that these two forms of chromosomal instability can be mechanistically interlinked. We first summarize how replication stress causes structural and numerical CIN, focusing on mechanisms such as mitotic rescue of replication stress (MRRS) and centriole disengagement, which prevent or contribute to specific types of structural chromosome aberrations and segregation errors. We describe the main outcomes of segregation errors and how micronucleation and aneuploidy can be the key stimuli promoting inflammation, senescence, or chromothripsis. At the end, we discuss how CIN can reduce cellular fitness and may behave as an anticancer barrier in noncancerous cells or precancerous lesions, whereas it fuels genomic instability in the context of cancer, and how our current knowledge may be exploited for developing cancer therapies.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"The rapid growth in cases of COVID-19 has threatened to overwhelm healthcare systems in multiple countries. In response, severely affected countries have had to consider a range of public health strategies achieved by implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions. Broadly, these strategies have fallen into two categories: i) \\\"mitigation\\\", which aims to achieve herd immunity by allowing the SARS-CoV-2 virus to spread through the population while mitigating disease burden, and ii) \\\"suppression\\\", aiming to drastically reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates and halt endogenous transmission in the target population. Using an age-structured transmission model, parameterised to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK, we assessed the prospects of success using both of these approaches. We simulated a range of different non-pharmaceutical intervention scenarios incorporating social distancing applied to differing age groups. We found that it is possible to suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission if social distancing measures are sustained at a sufficient level for a period of months. Our modelling did not support achieving herd immunity as a practical objective, requiring an unlikely balancing of multiple poorly-defined forces. Specifically, we found that: i) social distancing must initially reduce the transmission rate to within a narrow range, ii) to compensate for susceptible depletion, the extent of social distancing must be vary over time in a precise but unfeasible way, and iii) social distancing must be maintained for a long duration (over 6 months).\",\n",

Clinical data of 8 patients with HLH-HL and 20 non-HLH-HL patients were included. All eight HLH-HL patients tested positive for plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-DNA and EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER), and six patients were positive for EBV-DNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Two out of the 20 non-HLH-HL patients were confirmed positive for EBER, and the remaining 18 patients were negative. Among the HLH-HL patients, five patients received ABVD (doxorubicin/bleomycin/vinblastine/dacarbazine) chemotherapy regimens in other hospitals, and their conditions were considered to be worse, for which reason they were transferred to our center, and three patients were treated with DEP (doxorubicin-etoposide-methylprednisolone) regimens to target HLH and were alive as of the writing of this article. Two patients were critically ill upon admission and were not able to undergo chemotherapy. Significant differences in survival time were observed between the HLH-HL and non-HLH-HL patients (P = 0.005). HL patients found positive for EBV (plasma/PBMCs EBV-DNA(+)/EBER(+)) may be more likely to develop HLH-HL. It may be beneficial to target HLH during the acute phase of HLH, followed by treating HL once the HLH condition has stabilized. HLH-HL patients have worse prognosis and higher mortality than non-HLH-HL patients.\",\n",

Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) is associated with endothelial damage, neurotoxicity and increased risk for vascular diseases. Interestingly, both heme biosynthesis and sulphur amino acid metabolism require vitamin B6, (Pyridoxal-phosphate, PLP) an important cofactor of ALAS1 and of cystathionine \\u03b2-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine \\u03b3-lyase (CGL) enzymes that catabolize homocysteine (Hcy). Moreover, heme itself is an important cofactor for CBS.\\nto assess plasma Hcy status and HHcy main determinants in patients with AP.\\nA total of 46 patients with AP (31 with Acute Intermittent Porphyria,15 with Variegate Porphyria) were assessed for clinical status (symptomatic vs. asymptomatic), serum Hcy, Cysteine (Cys), Vit.B6, Vit.B12, red blood cell folates and urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen(PBG) levels (mean of six measurements).\\nSymptomatic AP patients had significantly higher urinary ALA and PBG levels, plasma Hcy, HHcy prevalence and Hcy/Cys ratio when compared to asymptomatic carriers of AP. Even though no significant correlation was observed between ALA/PBG urinary levels and serum Hcy levels, patients with higher levels of ALA and PBG had significantly higher levels of Hcy, a higher prevalence of moderate-to severe HHcy and serum PLP levels below the 25\\nMost patients with symptomatic AP present HHcy resulting from alterations in sulphur amino acid metabolism. HHcy may represent an indirect marker of ALAS1 induction and its prevalence may be suggestive of a role of HHcy in the pathogenesis and/or comorbidities of AP.\",\n",

The complex interaction of these two pathologies poses specific diagnostic and management challenges. The prognostic implications of this clinical intersection are not defined yet. Moreover, whether TAVR may have a prognostic benefit in ATTR-CA patients with symptomatic severe AS remains unclear, posing doubts on the best management strategy in this increasingly recognized subset of patients.\\nWe present a case of an 87-year old man with low-flow low-gradient severe AS, for whom a diagnosis of ATTR-CA was suspected based on clinical and echocardiographic criteria specific to coexisting AS and ATTR-CA. The diagnosis was eventually confirmed by positive bone tracer scintigraphy imaging. Following in-depth Heart team discussion, integrating frailty and prognostic information from combined cardiomyopathy states, a decision was made to manage the patient's severe AS conservatively.\\nIn the presented case, we deemed the natural history of ATTR-CA amyloidosis to negatively affect both the patient' prognosis and procedural risk, adversing TAVR indication despite symptomatic severe AS. No clear evidence is currently available to guide decision making in this setting, advocating for prospective studies to clarify if TAVR may have a prognostic benefit in ATTR-CA - and which ATTR-CA - patients.\",\n",

            "    \"abstract\": \"Continuous monitoring of frail individuals for detecting dangerous situations during their daily living at home can be a powerful tool toward their inclusion in the society by allowing living independently while safely. To this goal we developed a pose recognition system tailored to disabled students living in college dorms and based on skeleton tracking through four Kinect One devices independently recording the inhabitant with different viewpoints, while preserving the individual's privacy. The system is intended to classify each data frame and provide the classification result to a further decision-making algorithm, which may trigger an alarm based on the classified pose and the location of the subject with respect to the furniture in the room. An extensive dataset was recorded on 12 individuals moving in a mockup room and undertaking four poses to be recognized: standing, sitting, lying down, and \\\"dangerous sitting.\\\" The latter consists of the subject slumped in a chair with his/her head lying forward or backward as if unconscious. Each skeleton frame was labeled and represented using 10 discriminative features: three skeletal joint vertical coordinates and seven relative and absolute angles describing articular joint positions and body segment orientation. In order to classify the pose of the subject in each skeleton frame we built a two hidden layers multi-layer perceptron neural network with a \\\"SoftMax\\\" output layer, which we trained on the data from 10 of the 12 subjects (495,728 frames), with the data from the two remaining subjects representing the test set (106,802 frames). The system achieved very promising results, with an average accuracy of 83.9% (ranging 82.7 and 94.3% in each of the four classes). Our work proves the usefulness of human pose recognition based on machine learning in the field of safety monitoring in assisted living conditions.\",\n",

            "Keywords: \"affective empathy\", \"cognitive empathy\", \"offenders\", \"parenting style\", \"socioemotional well-being\"\n",
            "Like their homing after transplantation to bone marrow (BM), the mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) is still not fully understood, and several overlapping pathways are involved. Several years ago our group proposed that sterile inflammation in the BM microenvironment induced by pro-mobilizing agents is a driving force in this process. In favor of our proposal, both complement cascade (ComC)-deficient and Nlrp3 inflammasome-deficient mice are poor G-CSF and AMD3100 mobilizers. It is also known that the Nlrp3 inflammasome mediates its effects by activating caspase-1, which is responsible for proteolytic activation of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) and their release from cells along with several danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs). We observed in the past that IL-1β and IL-18 independently promote mobilization of HSPCs. In the current work we demonstrated that caspase-1-KO mice are poor mobilizers, and, to our surprise, administration of IL-1β or IL-18, as in the case of Nlrp3-KO animals, does not correct this defect. Moreover, neither Caspase-1-KO nor Nlrp3-KO mice properly activated the ComC to execute the mobilization process. Interestingly, mobilization in these animals and activation of the ComC were both restored after injection of the DAMP cocktail eATP+HGMB1+S100A9, the components of which are normally released from cells in an Nlrp3 inflammasome-caspase-1-dependent manner. In addition, we report that caspase-1-deficient HSPCs show a decrease in migration in response to BM homing factors and engraft more poorly after transplantation. These results for the first time identify caspase-1 as an orchestrator of HSPC trafficking.\n",

            "Keywords: \"eye-tracking\", \"fear chemosignals\", \"olfaction\", \"threat detection\", \"vigilance\"\n",
            "It has been shown that the presence of conspecifics modulates human vigilance strategies as is the case with animal species. Mere presence has been found to reduce vigilance. However, animal research has also shown that chemosignals (e.g., sweat) produced during fear-inducing situations modulate individuals' threat detection strategies. In the case of humans, little is known about how exposure to conspecifics' fear chemosignals modulates vigilance and threat detection effectiveness. This study (N = 59) examined how human fear chemosignals affect vigilance strategies and threat avoidance in its receivers. We relied on a paradigm that simulates a \"foraging under threat\" situation in the lab, integrated with an eye-tracker to examine the attention allocation. Our results showed that the exposure to fear chemosignals (vs. rest chemosignals and a no-sweat condition) while not changing vigilance behavior leads to faster answers to threatening events. In conclusion, fear chemosignals seem to constitute an important warning signal for human beings, possibly leading their receiver to a readiness state that allows faster reactions to threat-related events.\n",

            "While individual perceptions of risk are central to many behavioral theories of hazard response and are of considerable interest in both conceptual and applied work surrounding risk, hazards, and decision making, there is currently no consensus on how perceived risk should best be measured. Several recent efforts have laid the groundwork for a conceptual model outlining four key factors that make up risk perception: exposure, susceptibility, severity, and affective response. In this article, we use an extensive scale-development process to develop empirically supported 3-4 item subscales to measure each of those four dimensions. Using cognitive interviewing techniques and several quantitative psychometric methods including exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis and item-response theory analyses, we reduce a large set of potential items to the highest-quality items to assess each subscale. These subscales can be used to make comparisons across perceived risk in different hazard contexts and populations.\n",

            "The third Sustainable Development Goal for 2030 development agenda aims to reduce maternal and newborn deaths. Pregnant women's understanding of danger signs is an important factor in seeking timely care during emergencies. We assessed knowledge of obstetric danger signs using both recall and understanding of appropriate action required during obstetric emergencies.\n",
            "This was a cross-sectional study among pregnant women attending antenatal clinic at Bhutan's largest hospital in Thimphu. Recall was assessed against seven obstetric danger signs outlined in the Mother and Child Health Handbook (7 points). Understanding of danger signs was tested using 13 multiple choice questions (13 points). Knowledge was scored out of 20 points and reported as 'good' (≥80%), 'satisfactory' (60-79%) and 'poor' (< 60%). Correlation between participant characteristics and knowledge score as well as number of danger signs recalled was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Association between knowledge score and participant characteristics was tested using t-tests (and Kruskal-Wallis test) for numeric variables. Socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associated with the level of knowledge ('good' versus 'satisfactory' and 'poor' combined) were assessed with odds ratios using a log-binomial regression model. All results with p < 0.05 were considered significant.\n",
            "Four hundred and twenty-two women responded to the survey (response rate = 96.0%). Mean (±SD) knowledge score was 12 (±2.5). Twenty women (4.7%) had 'good' knowledge, 245 (58.1%) had 'satisfactory' knowledge and 157 (37.2%) had 'poor' knowledge. The median number of danger signs recalled was 2 (IQR 1, 3) while 68 women (20.3%) could not recall any danger signs. Most women were knowledgeable about pre-labour rupture of membranes (96.0%) while very few women were knowledgeable about spotting during pregnancy (19.9%). Both knowledge score and number of danger signs recalled had significant correlation with the period of gestation. Women with previous surgery on the reproductive tract had higher odds of having 'good' level of knowledge.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Batesian mimicry\", \"aggressive mimicry\", \"mate search\", \"optimal foraging\", \"sequential encounters\", \"signal detection theory\"\n",
            "AbstractSignal detection theory (SDT) has been used to model optimal stimulus discrimination for more than four decades in evolutionary ecology. A popular standard model that maximizes payoff per encounter was recently criticized for being too simplistic, leading to erroneous predictions. We review a number of SDT models that have received less attention but have explicitly taken repeated encounters into account, focusing on prey choice, mate search, aggressive mimicry, and the aiding of kin. We show how these models can be seen as variants of a second standard model that can be analyzed in a unified framework. In contrast to the simpler model, in this second model a higher probability of an undesirable or dangerous event occurring may either decrease or increase the receiver's acceptance rates. In each instance, the latter outcome requires undesirable events to be undesirable in a relative rather than an absolute sense. Increasing the abundance of desirable signalers or the payoff from accepting them may also either raise or reduce acceptance rates. Our synthesis highlights fundamental similarities among models previously studied on a case-by-case basis and challenges some long-held beliefs. For example, some classic predictions of Batesian mimicry can be reversed when model prey are protected by low profitability rather than harmful defense.\n",

This study showed that mannose-derived carbon dots (Man-CDs) could effectively capture several \"danger signals\" (DS) after MWA treatment and then deliver DS specifically to dendritic cells (DCs). This improved delivery of DS to DCs enhanced the processing and presentation of tumor-associated antigens by DCs. The results demonstrated that intratumoral injection of Man-CDs after MWA therapy elicited a potent tumor-specific immune response and finally led to the effective suppression of both primary and distant tumors. MWA + Man-CD treatment could efficiently reject tumor cell rechallenge \n",

            "Maternal mortality can be prevented in low-income settings through early health care seeking during maternity complications. While health system reforms in India prioritised institutional deliveries, inadequate antenatal and postnatal services limit the knowledge of danger signs of obstetric complications to women, which delays the recognition of complications and seeking appropriate health care. Recently, a novel rapidly scalable community-based program combining maternal health literacy delivery through microfinance-based women-only self-help groups (SHG) was implemented in rural India. This study evaluates the impact of the integrated microfinance and health literacy (IMFHL) program on the knowledge of maternal danger signs in marginalised women from one of India's most populated and poorer states - Uttar Pradesh. Additionally, the study evaluates the presence of a diffusion effect of the knowledge of maternal danger signs from SHG members receiving health literacy to non-members in program villages.\n",
            "Secondary data from the IMFHL program comprising 17,232 women from SHG and non-member households in rural Uttar Pradesh was included. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify the program's effects on the knowledge of maternal danger signs adjusting for a comprehensive range of confounders at the individual, household, and community level.\n",
            "SHG member women receiving health literacy were 27% more likely to know all danger signs as compared with SHG members only. Moreover, the results showed that the SHG network facilitates diffusion of knowledge of maternal danger signs from SHG members receiving health literacy to non-members in program villages. The study found that the magnitude of the program impact on outcome remained stable even after controlling for other confounding effects suggesting that the health message delivered through the program reaches all women uniformly irrespective of their socioeconomic and health system characteristics.\n",
            "The findings can guide community health programs and policy that seek to impact maternal health outcomes in low resource settings by demonstrating the differential impact of SHG alone and SHG plus health literacy on maternal danger sign knowledge.\n",

            "A \"superspreader\" refers to an unusually contagious organism infected with a disease. With respect to a human borne illnesses, a superspreader is someone who is more likely to infect other humans when compared to a typically infected person. The existence of human superspreaders is deeply entrenched in history; the most famous case being that of Typhoid Mary. Through contact tracing, epidemiologists have identified human superspreaders in measles, tuberculosis, rubella, monkeypox, smallpox, Ebola hemorrhagic fever, and SARS. The recent outbreak of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has shifted the focus back on the superspreaders. We herein present a case report of a COVID-19 superspreader with a hitherto unusually high number of infected contacts. The index case was a 33 year old male who resided in a low income settlement comprising of rehabilitated slum dwellers and worked as a healthcare worker (HCW) in a tertiary care hospital and had tested positive for COVID-19.On contact tracing, he had a total of 125 contacts, of which 49 COVID-19 infections had direct or indirect contact with the index case, qualifying him as a \"superspreader.\" This propagated infection led to an outbreak in the community. Contact tracing, testing and isolation of such superspreaders from the other members of the community is essential to stop the spread of this disease and contain the COVID-19 pandemic.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Apoptosis\", \"Danger\", \"Drug resistance\", \"EMT\", \"Glycolysis\", \"Tumors\"\n",
            "Tumor cells often switch from mitochondrial oxidative metabolism to glycolytic metabolism even under aerobic conditions. Tumor cell glycolysis is accompanied by several nonenzymatic activities among which induction of drug resistance has important therapeutic implications. In this article, we review the main aspects of glycolysis-induced drug resistance. We discuss the classes of antitumor drugs that are affected and the components of the glycolytic pathway (transporters, enzymes, metabolites) that are involved in the induction of drug resistance. Glycolysis-associated drug resistance occurs in response to stimuli, either cell-autonomous (e.g., oncoproteins) or deriving from the tumor microenvironment (e.g., hypoxia or pseudohypoxia, mechanical cues, etc.). Several mechanisms mediate the induction of drug resistance in response to glycolytic metabolism: inhibition of apoptosis, induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, induction of autophagy, inhibition of drug influx and increase of drug efflux. We suggest that drug resistance in response to glycolysis comes into play in presence of qualitative (e.g., expression of embryonic enzyme isoforms, post-translational enzyme modifications) or quantitative (e.g., overexpression of enzymes or overproduction of metabolites) alterations of glycolytic metabolism. We also discern similarities between changes occurring in tumor cells in response to stimuli inducing glycolysis-associated drug resistance and those occurring in cells of the innate immune system in response to danger signals and that have been referred to as danger-associated metabolic modifications. Eventually, we briefly address that also mitochondrial oxidative metabolism may induce drug resistance and discuss the therapeutic implications deriving from the fact that the main energy-generating metabolic pathways may be both at the origin of antitumor drug resistance.\n",

            "Clinical forensic assessments of injuries' life-threatening danger may have an impact on the legal aftermath following a violent assault. The pursuit of evidence-based guidelines should ensure a user-independent and reproducible forensic practice. However, does it? The aim of this study was to evaluate the forensic life-threatening danger assessments after a protocol implementation in 2016. The evaluation concerned usability and reproducibility of the protocol, and its influence on assessment severity. We analyzed the level of inter- and intra-rater agreement using 169 blinded, prior-protocol cases that were reassessed by two forensic specialists. We compared assessment made the year before and after protocol implementation (n = 262), and the forensic specialists' reassessments with the prior-protocol cases' original assessments (n = 169). Whether to make an assessment, the levels of agreement varied between weak agreement (inter-rater, Κ = 0.43; assessor 1, Κ = 0.57) and strong agreement (assessor 2, Κ = 0.90). Regarding severity, the levels of agreement varied between strong agreement (inter-rater, Κ = 0.87; assessor 1: Κ = 0.90) and almost perfect agreement (assessor 2: Κ = 0.94). The assessments were statistically significant redistributed after the implementation (chi-square test: p < 0.0001). The proportion of cases assessed as having not been in life-threatening danger increased from 9 to 43%, and moderate severity assessments decreased from 55 to 23%. Of the moderate severity assessments, 55% were reassessed as having not been in life-threatening danger. The protocol ensured independent and reproducible assessments when the forensic specialists agreed on making one. The protocol resulted in less severe assessments. Future studies should examine the reliability of the protocol and its consequences for legal aftermaths.\n",

            "The impact of SARS-CoV-2 in regions endemic for both Dengue and Chikungunya is still not fully understood. Considering that symptoms/clinical features displayed during Dengue, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 acute infections are similar, undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in co-endemic areas may be more prevalent than expected. This study was conducted to assess the prevalence of covert cases of SARS-CoV-2 among samples from patients with clinical symptoms compatible with either Dengue or Chikungunya viral infection in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil.\n",
            "Presence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody specific to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein was detected using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay in samples from 7,370 patients, without previous history of COVID-19 diagnosis, suspected of having either Dengue (n = 1,700) or Chikungunya (n = 7,349) from December 1st, 2019 to June 30th, 2020.\n",

Cross-reactivity with either Dengue virus or other common coronaviruses were not observed.\n",
            "Our findings demonstrate that concomitant Dengue or Chikungunya outbreaks may difficult the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infections. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate, with a robust sample size (n = 7,370) and using highly specific and sensitive chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method, that covert SARS-CoV-2 infections are more frequent than previously expected in Dengue and Chikungunya hyperendemic regions. Moreover, our results suggest that SAR-CoV-2 cases were occurring prior to February, 2020, and that these undiagnosed missed cases may have contributed to the fast expansion of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in Brazil. Data presented here demonstrate that in arboviral endemic regions, SARS-CoV-2 infection must be always considered, regardless of the existence of a previous positive diagnosis for Dengue or Chikungunya.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Climate\", \"Fire season\", \"Forest fire\", \"Temperature\", \"Turkey\"\n",
            "In contrast to the expectations of an increase in annual fire activity and the severity of fire season due to climate change and large fires, which have been occurring in recent years, a downtrend has been identified in fire activity in many studies conducted for the whole of Europe in recent years. Similarly, in Turkey, according to the General Directorate of Forestry statistics, while there is an increase in the number of annual fires, the burnt area has a downtrend pattern. In this study, fire activity and climate data statistics for Turkey were examined along with the fire season length and severity. The results obtained conform with the studies conducted in places from Spain at the westernmost part of Mediterranean Europe to Israel at the easternmost part of the Mediterranean. Considering the changes in temperatures, temperature rise of 2 to 3 °C was detected at all stations in the study area. No decrease was observed in the average temperatures at any of the stations within the study period between 1940 and 2018. On the other hand, the precipitation trend varied according to the stations. Although there have been increases in precipitation in Fethiye, Isparta, and Marmaris since 1960, the decrease in precipitation by 132 mm in Afyon since 1970 and the decrease in precipitation by 137 mm in Bodrum since 1940 are attention-grabbing. These stations are followed by Izmir station with 66 mm and Cesme station with 37 mm of decrease, despite being smaller decreases. In the study, the long-term (1940-2018) data of the meteorological stations discussed within the study, the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) and the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) values were calculated. According to the FWI results used in determining the severity and length of fire season on the coastline of Turkey from the northern Aegean to Antalya, the likelihood of large fires decreased by about 52% in 2018 compared to 1970. This decrease in FWI value indicates that the fire severity is reduced. The specified decrease in fire severity also explains the reason of the decrease in the burnt area that occurred over the years in Turkey. No significant change was observed in the FFMC values indicating the possibility of human-induced fires between 1970 and 2018.\n",

            "Clinical forensic medical examinations constitute an increasing proportion of our institution's tasks, and, concomitantly, the authorities are now requesting forensic life-threatening danger assessments based on our examinations. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess if a probability of survival (PS) trauma score could be useful for these forensic life-threatening danger assessments and to identify a cut-off PS score as a supporting tool for the forensic practice of assessing life-threatening danger. We compared a forensic database and a trauma database and identified 161 individuals (aged 15 years or older) who had both a forensic life-threatening danger assessment and a PS score. The life-threatening danger assessments comprised the following statements: was not in life-threatening danger (NLD); could have been in life-threatening danger (CLD); or was in life-threatening danger (LD). The inclusion period was 2012-2016. A statistically significant difference was found in the PS scores between NLD, CLD and LD (chi-square test: p < 0.0001). The usefulness of the PS score for categorizing life-threatening danger assessments was determined by a receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under the curve was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.69 to 0.84) and the ROC curve revealed that a cut-off PS score of 95.8 would appropriately identify LD. Therefore, a PS score below 95.8 would indicate life-threatening danger. We propose a further exploration of how the evidence-based PS score, including a cut-off value, might be implemented in clinical forensic medical statements to add to the scientific strength of these statements.\n",

            "During the COVID-19 pandemic, the public was regularly presented with visualizations of the viral pathogen causing this disease. Since there are several ways of visually communicating information, we investigate whether different types of visualizations affect how viewers judge the credibility of information as well as the complexity and potential harm of pathogens. A first experiment was conducted to assess whether a round, fluent shape elicits a different response than pathogens featuring disfluent components such as thread-like appendages. Visualizations of disfluent bacteria were rated as more credible than those of fluent bacteria. In Experiment 2, bacteria were either presented as realistic renderings or as cartoon-like line drawings (varied between-subjects). Furthermore, half of the six bacteria had fluent shapes, while the other half featured disfluent shapes, resulting in the within-subjects factor of fluency. Participants were asked to rate the credibility, complexity, and risk of serious illness associated with these bacteria. We found that disfluent bacteria were perceived as having a more complex metabolism and as holding a higher risk for serious illness. Furthermore, realism and disfluent shapes increase the credibility of visualizations, but not the credibility of additional information. These results have important implications for the field of science communication.\n",

            "Be it as a nicotine replacement or a fashionable seduction for young people or casual smokers with or without nicotine additives - the popularity of e-cigarettes in Europe has increased during the past decade. In addition to the potential of long-term pulmonary damage, which is still largely unknown to date, there is a risk of battery explosion with specific injury patterns. Most users are unaware of the danger in their pockets.\n",
            "Between February and July 2019, four patients were treated with burns from exploded e-cigarettes in the burn centre at Sana Hospital in Offenbach am Main (Germany). This article describes the cause and extent of the injury and its treatment.\n",
            "In all patients, the cause of the explosion was what is called \"thermal runaway\" (very rapid discharge of the battery). The average age of the patients, who were exclusively male, was 37 (25-50) years. The combustion depth ranged from grade I to deep grade IIb. The burnt body surface averaged 3 % (0.5-4.5 %) TBSA and affected the body regions that are typically in direct contact with the e-cigarette: thighs, genitals and hands. Conservative treatment was successful in one case and surgical treatment in two cases (two alloplastic covers, one meshed split-skin transplant). One patient discharged himself from hospital against medical advice after initial treatment. The average time in hospital for the three remaining patients was 15.6 days (6-17).\n",
            "Burns from an exploding e-cigarette represent a rare new entity. The force of the explosion of the battery body leads to injury patterns that require treatment in specialised centres with the entire spectrum of burn care. Mixed injuries with deep burns occur at the predilection sites due to thermal action, colliquative necrosis due to leaking electrolyte fluid and contamination by foreign bodies (metallic lithium, splinters of the destroyed housing) and require special initial measures. The extinction of fire caused by e-cigarettes also requires special measures. Proper handling of CE-certified devices is essential. Manipulation of the device in the event of defective functions or defective batteries is highly dangerous and should be strictly prohibited. General security requirements must be observed.\n",
            "Seit ungefähr einem Jahrzehnt erfährt die elektronische Zigarette (E-Zigarette) in Europa eine zunehmende Beliebtheit, sei es als Nikotinersatztherapie, als trendige Verführung für Jugendliche, oder für Gelegenheitsraucher mit oder ohne Nikotinzusatz. Neben dem noch weitgehend unbekannten pulmonalen Schadenspotenzial einer Langzeitexposition kann es zu einer Explosion von Akkumulatoren mit spezifischen Verletzungsmustern kommen. Die meisten Anwender sind sich der Gefahr in der Hosentasche nicht bewusst.\n",
            "Zwischen Februar und Juli 2019 wurden 4 Patienten mit Verbrennungen durch explodierte E-Zigaretten im Zentrum für Schwerbrandverletzte im Sana Klinikum Offenbach am Main behandelt. Die Ursache, das Ausmaß der Verletzung sowie deren Behandlung werden im Folgenden dargestellt.\n",
            "Das Durchschnittsalter der ausschließlich männlichen Patienten betrug 37 (25–50) Jahre. Die Ursache war bei allen Patienten ein sog. „thermal runaway“ (sehr rasche Entladung des Akkumulators). Die Verbrennungstiefe reichte von Grad I bis tief Grad IIb. Die verbrannte Körperoberfläche betrug durchschnittlich 3 (0,5–4,5) % vKOF und betraf die Körperregionen, die bei den Benutzern typischerweise in unmittelbarem Kontakt mit der E-Zigarette sind: Oberschenkel, Genital und Hände. Eine konservative Therapie war in 1 Fall und eine chirurgische Therapie in 2 Fällen erfolgreich (2 alloplastische Deckungen, 1 Spalthauttransplantation). Ein Patient entließ sich nach Erstversorgung gegen ärztlichen Rat. Die durchschnittliche Hospitalisationsdauer von 3 Patienten lag bei 15,6 Tagen (6–17).\n",
            "Verbrennungen durch eine explodierende E-Zigarette stellen eine neue seltenere Entität dar. Durch die Wucht der Explosion eines Batteriekörpers kommt es zu Verletzungsmustern, die eine Behandlung in spezialisierten Zentren mit dem gesamten Spektrum der Verbrennungsmedizin erfordern. Es entstehen Mischverletzungen an den Prädilektionsstellen mit tiefen Verbrennungen durch thermische Einwirkung, Kolliquationsnekrosen durch austretende Elektrolytflüssigkeit und eine Kontamination durch Fremdkörper (metallisches Lithium, Splitter des zerstörten Gehäuses), die besondere Erstmaßnahmen erfordern. Auch die Löschung von Bränden durch E-Zigaretten erfordert spezielle Maßnahmen. Ein sachgemäßer Umgang mit CE-zertifizierten Geräten ist essenziell. Eine Manipulation des Gerätes bei defekten Funktionen bzw. defekten Akkus ist höchst gefährdend und sollte strengstens untersagt werden. Allgemeine Sicherheitsvorgaben müssen beachtet werden.\n",

            "Fibrillar aggregates and soluble oligomers of both Amyloid-β peptides (Aβs) and hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins (p-Tau-es), as well as a chronic neuroinflammation are the main drivers causing progressive neuronal losses and dementia in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms are still much disputed. Several endogenous neurotoxic ligands, including Aβs, and/or p-Tau-es activate innate immunity-related danger-sensing/pattern recognition receptors (PPRs) thereby advancing AD's neuroinflammation and progression. The major PRR families involved include scavenger, Toll-like, NOD-like, AIM2-like, RIG-like, and CLEC-2 receptors, plus the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). This quite intricate picture stresses the need to identify the pathogenetically topmost Aβ-activated PRR, whose signaling would trigger AD's three main drivers and their intra-brain spread. In theory, the candidate might belong to any PRR family. However, results of preclinical studies using in vitro nontumorigenic human cortical neurons and astrocytes and in vivo AD-model animals have started converging on the CaSR as the pathogenetically upmost PRR candidate. In fact, the CaSR binds both Ca\n",

            "The goal of metabolomics is to measure as many metabolites as possible in order to capture biomarkers that may indicate disease mechanisms. Variable selection in chemometric methods can be divided into the following two groups: (1) sparse methods that find the minimal set of variables to discriminate between groups and (2) methods that find all variables important for discrimination. Such important variables can be summarized into metabolic pathways using pathway analysis tools like Mummichog. As a test case, we studied the metabolic effects of treatment with nicotinamide riboside, a form of vitamin B3, in a cohort of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. Vitamin B3 is an important co-factor for many enzymatic reactions in the human body. Thus, the variable selection method was expected to find vitamin B3 metabolites and also other secondary metabolic changes during treatment. However, sparse methods did not select any vitamin B3 metabolites despite the fact that these metabolites showed a large difference when comparing intensity before and during treatment. Univariate analysis or significance multivariate correlation (sMC) in combination with pathway analysis using Mummichog were able to select vitamin B3 metabolites. Moreover, sMC analysis found additional metabolites. Therefore, in our comparative study, sMC displayed the best performance for selection of relevant variables.\n",

            "Lebanon boosts one of the highest pharmacists to population ratios globally (20.3/10,000). Yet, workforce analysis elicited serious concerns with the distribution, practice environments and regulation of Lebanese pharmacists. Recent workforce data shows that the profession has been majorly destabilized with hundreds of pharmacists closing their pharmacies or losing their employment. Proper planning for the future of the pharmacy profession in Lebanon necessitates a deeper understanding of the current challenges and the necessary policy and practice recommendations. The aim of this study is to examine stakeholders' perspectives on the current pharmacist workforce challenges and the necessary measures to support the profession.\n",
            "The research team carried out a series of semi-structured interviews with twenty-one key stakeholders within the pharmacy profession in Lebanon. We categorized stakeholders according to their experience as policy makers, practitioners, academicians, and media experts. The interview guide included questions about workforce trends, labor market challenges and recommendations for improvement. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed thematically.\n",
            "Four major themes emerged from this study: the oversupply of pharmacists in Lebanon, the demand supply imbalance, poor regulation of the pharmacy practice, and the difficult practice environment. There was a consensus among interviewees that the oversupply of pharmacists is due to the poor workforce planning and weak regulatory framework, combined with the easy integration of foreign-trained pharmacists into the labor market. The lack of coordination between the educational and practice sectors is further widening the demand-supply gap. Interviewees further revealed that the regulatory policies on pharmacy practice were outdated and/or weakly enforced which increases the risk of unethical practices and erodes the image of pharmacists in the society. With respect to the practice environment, there is an ongoing struggle by Lebanese pharmacists to maintain profitability and exercise their full scope of practice.\n",
            "The poor pharmacy workforce planning and regulation is significantly weakening the pharmacy profession in Lebanon. A concerted effort between the various stakeholders is necessary to enhance workforce planning, regulate supply, optimize the integration of pharmacists into work sectors of need, and improve the financial and professional wellbeing of pharmacists in Lebanon.\n",

            "We are in unprecedented times with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has impacted public health, the economy and our society on a global scale. In addition, the impacts of COVID-19 permeate into our environment and wildlife as well. Here, we discuss the essential role of wastewater treatment and management during these times. A consequence of poor wastewater management is the discharge of untreated wastewater carrying infectious SARS-CoV-2 into natural water systems that are home to marine mammals. Here, we predict the susceptibility of marine mammal species using a modelling approach. We identified that many species of whale, dolphin and seal, as well as otters, are predicted to be highly susceptible to infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In addition, geo-mapping highlights how current wastewater management in Alaska may lead to susceptible marine mammal populations being exposed to the virus. Localities such as Cold Bay, Naknek, Dillingham and Palmer may require additional treatment of their wastewater to prevent virus spillover through sewage. Since over half of these susceptibility species are already at risk worldwide, the release of the virus via untreated wastewater could have devastating consequences for their already declining populations. For these reasons, we discuss approaches that can be taken by the public, policymakers and wastewater treatment facilities to reduce the risk of virus spillover in our natural water systems. Thus, we indicate the potential for reverse zoonotic transmission of COVID-19 and its impact on marine wildlife; impacts that can be mitigated with appropriate action to prevent further damage to these vulnerable populations.\n",

            "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by gait impairments and severely impacts the quality of life. Technological advances in biomechanics offer objective assessments of gait disabilities in clinical settings. Here we employed wearable sensors to measure electromyography (EMG) and body acceleration during walking and to quantify the altered gait pattern between people with progressive MS (PwPMS) and healthy controls (HCs). Forty consecutive patients attending our department as in-patients were examined together with fifteen healthy controls. All subjects performed the timed 10 min walking test (T10MW) using a wearable accelerator and 8 electrodes attached to bilateral thighs and legs so that body acceleration and EMG activity were recorded. The T10MWs were recorded under three conditions: standard (wearing shoes), reduced grip (wearing socks) and increased cognitive load (backward-counting dual-task). PwPMS showed worse kinematics of gait and increased muscle coactivation than controls at both the thigh and leg levels. Both reduced grip and increased cognitive load caused a reduction in the cadence and velocity of the T10MW, which were correlated with one another. A higher coactivation index at the thigh level of the more affected side was positively correlated with the time of the T10MW (r = 0.5, \n",

            "Clotting and inflammation are effective danger response patterns positively selected by evolution to limit fatal bleeding and pathogen invasion upon traumatic injuries. As a trade-off, thrombotic, and thromboembolic events complicate severe forms of infectious and non-infectious states of acute and chronic inflammation, i.e., immunothrombosis. Factors linked to thrombosis and inflammation include mediators released by platelet granules, complement, and lipid mediators and certain integrins. Extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was a previously unrecognized cellular component in the blood, which elicits profound proinflammatory and prothrombotic effects. Pathogens trigger the release of extracellular DNA together with other pathogen-associated molecular patterns. Dying cells in the inflamed or infected tissue release extracellular DNA together with other danger associated molecular pattern (DAMPs). Neutrophils release DNA by forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) during infection, trauma or other forms of vascular injury. Fluorescence tissue imaging localized extracellular DNA to sites of injury and to intravascular thrombi. Functional studies using deoxyribonuclease (DNase)-deficient mouse strains or recombinant DNase show that extracellular DNA contributes to the process of immunothrombosis. Here, we review rodent models of immunothrombosis and the evolving evidence for extracellular DNA as a driver of immunothrombosis and discuss challenges and prospects for extracellular DNA as a potential therapeutic target.\n",

This study employs a content analysis of the organization's 2012-2019 blog posts, while further considering Australian-specific vaccine contexts. The goal is to identify the persuasion attributes of these counter-vaccine articles, and the ways that the group's media employs persuasive cues when communicating to Australian publics. The project gauges the occurrence rates of message variables associated with the Elaboration Likelihood Model of persuasion, including those labeled as the Scarcity Principle, Arousal of Fear, Asking Questions, Source Cues, the Contrast Principle and Negativity Effect, as well as Statistics and Technical Jargon. Three overarching themes collectively exhibited by these message variables are further identified and described as Distrust, Danger, and Confidence. In view of these findings, the study then considers how persuasive cue expression in Australian Vaccination-risks Network blog posts corresponds with Australian vaccine hesitancies and the country's No Jab No Pay/Play policies.\n",

The order to cover the mouth and nose in the public space has been introduced as one of the preventive measures to limit the spread of some virus-induced respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Both medical and non-medical masks have become the most popular tool. Is there any evidence of their effectiveness? What can be the disadvantages of using them?

Based on the UK Met Office's long-term temperature and rainfall records, we present the first evidence demonstrating significant increases in the magnitude, direction of change and spatial co-localisation of extreme weather events since 1961. Combining this new understanding with land-use data sets allowed us to assess the likely consequences on future agricultural production and conservation priority areas. All land-uses are impacted by the increasing risk of at least one extreme event and conservation areas were identified as the hotspots of risk for the co-occurrence of multiple event types. Our findings provide a basis to regionally guide land-use optimisation, land management practices and regulatory actions preserving ecosystem services against multiple climate threats.\n",

The prevalence rates of the nematode genera identified were determined, and the results were compared using Fisher's exact and chi-square frequency tests. Information about cases of larvae migrans in the population were collected from the Family Health Units and the private health plans.

            "Trauma and sepsis both increase the risk for secondary infections. Injury mobilizes mitochondrial (MT) danger-associated molecular patterns (mtDAMPs) directly from cellular necrosis. It is unknown, however, whether sepsis can cause active MT release and whether mtDAMPs released by sepsis might affect innate immunity.\n",

Release of MTG+ microparticles was studied using flow cytometry after bacterial stimulation by size exclusion chromatography of supernatants with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Human neutrophil (PMN), chemotaxis, and respiratory burst were studied after PMN incubation with mtDNA.\n",
            "LPS caused Mo to release mtDAMPs. Electron microscopy showed microparticles containing MT. mtDNA was present both in microvesicles and exosomes as shown by PCR of the relevant size exclusion chromatography bands. In functional studies, PMN incubation with mtDNA suppressed chemotaxis in a dose-dependent manner, which was reversed by chloroquine, suggesting an endosomal, toll-like receptor-9-dependent mechanism. In contrast, PMN respiratory burst was unaffected by mtDNA.\n",
            "In addition to passive release of mtDAMPs by traumatic cellular disruption, inflammatory and infectious stimuli cause active mtDAMP release via microparticles. mtDNA thus released can have effects on PMN that may suppress antimicrobial function. mtDAMP-mediated \"feed-forward\" mechanisms may modulate immune responses and potentially be generalizable to other forms of inflammation. Where they cause immune dysfunction the effects can be mitigated if the pathways by which the mtDAMPs act are defined. In this case, the endosomal inhibitor chloroquine is benign and well tolerated. Thus, it may warrant study as a prophylactic antiinfective after injury or prior sepsis.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Ecosystem service\", \"extreme weather\", \"land-use\"\n",
            "This study evaluates predictions central to the extended parallel process model (EPPM) in the context of dense breast notifications. Many EPPM propositions have gone untested and competing predictions to the model have been evaluated to an even lesser extent. Also left as an open question is exactly how perceived threat and efficacy constructs should be treated in health communication research. Using experimental data collected from women likely to receive dense breast notification letters (i.e., aged 40 to 50 years) in states with and without dense breast notification legislation, this study explicitly tests EPPM predictions regarding danger control responses. These data were largely unsupportive of the EPPM's predictions and instead finds that negative affect is more of a direct predictor of intention than expected. These data also provide evidence supporting the separate treatment of the perceived severity, susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy variables, contrary to convention in EPPM research. Implications for breast density research and EPPM theorizing are discussed in light of these findings.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Ecosystem service\", \"extreme weather\", \"land-use\"\n",
            "From the end of 2016 until the beginning of 2019, Brazil faced a massive sylvatic yellow fever (YF) outbreak. The 2016-2019 YF epidemics affected densely populated areas, especially the Southeast region, causing thousands of deaths of humans and non-human primates (NHP).\n",
            "We conducted a molecular investigation of yellow fever virus (YFV) RNA in 781 NHP carcasses collected in the urban, urban-rural interface, and rural areas of Minas Gerais state, from January 2017 to December 2018. Samples were analyzed according to the period of sampling, NHP genera, sampling areas, and sampling areas/NHP genera to compare the proportions of YFV-positive carcasses and the estimated YFV genomic loads. YFV infection was confirmed in 38.1% of NHP carcasses (including specimens of the genera Alouatta, Callicebus, Callithrix, and Sapajus), from the urban, urban-rural interface, and rural areas. YFV RNA detection was positively associated with epidemic periods (especially from December to March) and the rural environment. Higher median viral genomic loads (one million times) were estimated in carcasses collected in rural areas compared to urban ones.\n",
            "The results showed the wide occurrence of YF in Minas Gerais in epidemic and non-epidemic periods. According to the sylvatic pattern of YF, a gradient of viral dissemination from rural towards urban areas was observed. A high YF positivity was observed for NHP carcasses collected in urban areas with a widespread occurrence in 67 municipalities of Minas Gerais, including large urban centers. Although there was no documented case of urban/Aedes YFV transmission to humans in Brazil during the 2016-2019 outbreaks, YFV-infected NHP in urban areas with high infestation by Aedes aegypti poses risks for YFV urban/Aedes transmission and urbanization.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Danger signal\", \"Extravillous trophoblast\", \"Invasion\", \"P2Y14\", \"UDP-Glucose\"\n",
            "P2Y14, one of the P2Y purinergic G-protein coupled receptors, is expressed in a variety of cells and tissues. Its ligand, UDP-glucose (UDPG), is released from damaged and stress-stimulated cells and acts as a danger signal via P2Y14. Thus, P2Y14 plays an important role in immunological defense systems. Here, we aimed to elucidate the expression, localization, and role of P2Y14 in human trophoblasts and the placenta.\n",
            "Human chorionic villus and placental tissues were subjected to immunostaining for P2Y14 protein and an extravillous trophoblast (EVT) marker, HLA-G. We examined the expression of P2Y14 and the effect of UDPG on cell proliferation and invasion in an EVT cell line, HTR-8/SVneo, using an MTS assay and a Transwell assay, respectively. We tested the effect of UDPG on cell invasion in P2Y14-underexpressing HTR-8/SVneo clones established by the lentiviral introduction of shRNA for P2RY14 mRNA.\n",
            "Immunostaining revealed that P2Y14 was exclusively expressed by EVTs. P2RY14 mRNA and P2Y14 protein were expressed in HTR-8/SVneo cells. UDPG did not affect cell proliferation but it did enhance invasion. Inhibition of P2Y14 and decreasing the expression of P2Y14 suppressed UDPG-mediated invasive activity.\n",
            "These results showed that EVT selectively expressed P2Y14 and that P2Y14 was positively involved in UDPG-enhanced EVT invasion. It suggests the possible existence of a danger signal-mediated physiological system at the fetomaternal interface where UDPG released from maternal tissues through destruction by EVT invasion may accelerate EVT invasion, allowing EVTs to undergo successful placentation and vascular remodeling.\n",

            "The role of the male partner and wider family in maternal health, especially in case of emergencies, has been receiving increasing attention over the last decade. Qualitative research has highlighted that women depend on others to access high quality maternity care. Currently little is known about these factors in relation to maternal health in Mozambique.\n",
            "A cross sectional household survey was conducted with men and women in southern Mozambique about decision making, financial support and knowledge of danger signs. A multivariable logistic model was used to identify factors associated with knowledge of danger signs and Cohen's kappa for agreement among couples.\n",
            "A total of 775 men and women from Marracuene and Manhica districts were interviewed. Maternal health care decisions were frequently made jointly by the couple (32-49%) and financial support was mainly provided by the man (46-80%). Parental and parent-in-law involvement in decision making and financial support was minimal (0-3%). The average number of danger signs respondents knew was 2.05 and no significant difference (p = 0.294) was found between men and women. Communication with the partner was a significant predictor for higher knowledge of danger signs for both men (p = 0.01) and women (p = 0.03). There was very low agreement within couples regarding decision making (p = 0.04), financial support (p = 0.01) and presence at antenatal care consultations (p = 0.001). Results suggest women and men have a high willingness for more male participation in antenatal care, although their understanding of what constitutes this participation is not clear.\n",
            "The study findings highlight the important role men play in decision making and financial support for maternal health care issues. Strengthening male involvement in antenatal care services, by investing in counselling and receiving couples, could help accelerate gains in maternal health in Mozambique. Maternal health care studies should collect more data from men directly as men and women often report different views and behavior regarding maternal health care issues and male involvement.\n",

            "Stimulating the patient`s immune system represents a promising therapeutic strategy to fight cancer. However, low immunogenicity of the tumor cells within an immune suppressive milieu often leads to weak anti-tumor immune responses. Additionally, the immune system may be impaired by accompanying aggressive chemotherapies. We show that mitoxantrone, bound to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as the transport system, can be magnetically accumulated in adherent HT-29 colon carcinoma cells, thereby inducing the same cell death phenotype as its soluble counterpart, a chemotherapeutic agent and prototypic inductor of immunogenic cell death. The nanoparticle-loaded drug induces cell cycle stop, apoptosis and secondary necrosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner comparable to the free drug. Cell death was accompanied by the release of interleukin-8 and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such as HSP70 and ATP, which fostered chemotactic migration of monocytes and maturation of dendritic cells. We furthermore ensured absence of endotoxin contaminations and compatibility with erythrocytes and platelets and investigated the influence on plasma coagulation in vitro. Summarizing, with magnetic enrichment, mitoxantrone can be accumulated at the desired place, sparing healthy peripheral cells and tissues, such as immune cells. Conserving immune competence in cancer patients in the future might allow combined therapeutic approaches with immune therapies (e.g. checkpoint inhibitors).\n",

            "Maternal mortality remains unacceptably high due to pregnancy complications and remains the major health problems in many developing countries such as Ethiopia. Having poor knowledge of obstetric danger signs contributes to delays in seeking and receiving skilled care which in turn increases maternal mortality. However, in Ethiopia, studies are lacking regarding the knowledge level of mothers about obstetric danger signs during pregnancy, child birth, and postnatal periods. In Ethiopia, the proportion of those who have full knowledge of these obstetric danger signs during pregnancy, child birth, and postnatal period is not known. Despite few studies are conducted at health facility level focusing on danger signs during pregnancy, the issue of health-seeking action after identifying danger signs and attitude of mothers towards obstetric danger sign was not addressed.\n",

A pretested structured questionnaire was used to collect data from respondents. Data were entered to EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. To assess the associations between dependent and independent variables, binary and multivariate logistic regressions were employed, and the strength of association was presented using odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.\n",

            "Detection of predator cues changes the brain state in prey species and helps them avoid danger. Dysfunctionality in changing the central state appropriately in stressful situations is proposed to be an underlying cause of multiple psychiatric disorders in humans.\n",

            "We first show that 5-7 day old zebrafish larvae react to an alarm pheromone (Schreckstoff) with reduced mobility. They subsequently display heightened vigilance, as evidenced by increased dark avoidance. Calcium imaging indicates that exposure to Schreckstoff elicits stimulus-locked activity in olfactory sensory neurons innervating a lateral glomerulus and in telencephalic regions including the putative medial amygdala and entopeduncular nucleus. Sustained activity outlasting the stimulus delivery was detected in regions regulating neuromodulator release, including the lateral habenula, posterior tuberculum, superior raphe, and locus coeruleus.\n",

Exogenous pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs) trigger innate immune responses through well-understood cellular pathways. In contrast, endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) convey \"danger signals\" via their (mis)localization or modification. Both MAMPs and DAMPs are often communicated on or within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Despite growing evidence for the importance of EVs and their cargo in modulating innate immune responses, in some cases, it is unclear how EV-transported molecules are sensed as abnormal. In particular, EVs constitutively carry RNA, which is also abundant in the cytoplasm. How, then, would RNA convey a danger signal as a cargo of EVs? In this Perspective, we offer some thoughts on how EV-associated RNAs might raise the alarm for innate immune responses - or silence them.\n",

            "Filler injections are widely used for facial rejuvenation. The technique is safe as long as some precautions are respected. In this review we will focus on vascular anatomy in the upper, middle and lower face. We performed a PUBMED research on \"facial danger zones\" and \"filler injections\" and \"hyaluronic acid\" and \"vascular compromise\" with a focus on the last decade. This is of particular importance since vascular compromise is one of the most severe adverse events possibly leading to tissue necrosis and in rare cases to loss of vision. We describe the danger zones in these esthetic units and provide recommendations how to avoid severe adverse events. We report on temporal region, glabella and nose, infraorbital region, nasolabial folds and nasal triangle, lips, and chin. Although we focus on hyaluronic acid fillers, our recommendations will also scope other filler types and autologous adipose tissue transfer. We also take a closer look on innovations to improve the safety of facial filler injections. Facial rejuvenation with hyaluronic acid fillers is a popular method. It is safe if the facial danger zones are recognized and proper injection techniques and fillers are used.\n",

            "Within the metal/nonmetal mining sector, fall-related incidents account for a large proportion of fatal and non-fatal injuries. However, the events and contributing factors leading up to these incidents have not been fully investigated. To help provide a clearer picture of these factors, an analysis of imminent danger orders issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) between 2010 and 2017 at both surface and underground metal/nonmetal mine sites revealed that most orders are associated with fall risks. Of these cases, 84% involved the workers not using fall protection, fall protection not being provided, or the improper use of fall protection. Fall risks for workers most frequently occurred when standing on mobile equipment, performing maintenance and repairs on plant equipment, or working near highwalls. In most cases, a single, basic, corrective action (e.g., using fall protection) would have allowed workers to perform the task safely. Overall, these findings suggest that a systematic approach is needed to identify, eliminate, and prevent imminent danger situations. Furthermore, to protect mineworkers from falls from height, frequently performed tasks requiring fall protection should be redesigned to eliminate the reliance on personal fall protection.\n",

            "Sensory neurons are activated by physical and chemical stimuli, eliciting sensations such as temperature, touch, pain, and itch. From an evolutionary perspective, sensing danger is essential for organismal survival. Upon infection and injury, immune cells respond to pathogen/damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/DAMPs) through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and produce inflammatory mediators that activate sensory neurons through neuro-immune interactions. Sensory neurons also express TLRs and other PRRs that directly sense danger signals after injury or during infection, leading to pain, itch, or analgesia. In addition to slow-acting canonical TLR signaling, TLRs function uniquely in sensory neurons through non-canonical coupling to ion channels, enabling rapid modulation of neuronal activity. We discuss how sensory neurons utilize TLRs and other PRR pathways to detect danger signals in their environment.\n",

            "Superspreaders are critical infectious resources in multiple infectious diseases. They can be asymptomatic or present mild symptoms but can transmit pathogens to susceptible populations, leading to severe symptoms, and even death. Early identification of this population is extremely important to inhibit the spread of infectious diseases. Right now, the whole global world is suffering from a devastating infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In this article, a superspreader cluster event in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified by tracking contacting histories of infected patients. This cluster was found to be originated from an asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carrier, which resulted in 13 secondary cases getting infected. All the secondary patients presented with non-typical symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever, dry cough, and myalgia, one of which died of respiratory failure at the end. From this cluster, we learn that people with older ages, low immunity, multiple underlying diseases, especially pulmonary diseases, can contribute to a poor prognosis. Thus, asymptomatic superspreaders of COVID-19 can be extremely dangerous and must be handled time-efficiently.\n",

            "Aquaculture is a rapidly growing field of food production. However, morbidity and mortality are higher in aquaculture species than in domestic animals. Bacterial diseases are a leading cause of farmed fish morbidity and are often treated with antimicrobials. Since most Swiss fish farms release effluents directly into surface water without treatment and since aquaculture fish are consumed by humans, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and multi-resistance in aquaculture fish are important for environmental and public health. In this study, AMR tests for 14 antimicrobials were performed on 1,448 isolates from 1,134 diagnostic laboratory submissions from farmed and ornamental fish submissions for the period from 2000 to 2017. Amoxicillin, gentamycin and norfloxacin had the lowest proportion of resistant samples. However, AMR was highly variable over time. Resistance proportions were higher in: (a) ornamental fish compared with farmed fish, (b) fish from recirculation systems compared with those from other farming systems and (c) isolates originating from skin compared with those originating from inner organs. Multiple resistances were common. The results of this study provide useful data for Swiss fish veterinarians and some interesting hypotheses about risk factors for AMR in aquaculture and pet fish in Switzerland. However, further research is needed to define risk factors.\n",

            "In the last decades, the use of pesticides has grown worldwide. However, there is great worry about the impact of pesticides on human health, due to their wide distribution and possible long-term effects. Complex mixtures with different formulations are often used, including a variety of genotoxic compounds. Thus, genotoxicity tests form an important part of cancer research and risk assessment of potential carcinogens. This study aimed to conduct a meta-analytical review of possible genetic damage resulting from occupational exposure in farmworkers and workers employed in pesticide production, both ever in comparison to non-exposed people, using comet assay (CA), micronucleus test (MN) and telomere length (TL) data available in the scientific literature. A total of 145 datasets were evaluated. The results showed that the occupationally exposed workers had more DNA damage in CA and MN than non-exposed workers. The TL result did not show difference between groups. When the data were categorized by gender (male, female or both), crop (general, tobacco, fruits, soybeans, cotton) and occupation (manufacturing or farmworkers), the study found that the exposed group always presented higher damage than the non-exposed individuals, in CA and MN. More studies with TL are needed to obtain a more precise response, and to segregate the effect of tobacco farming from pesticide exposure. When TL was segregated by gender, women and men presented difference between exposed and non-exposed groups. In general, the publication bias impact was modest. If all relevant studies were included, the key finding (i.e. the effect of pesticide exposure increases the genotoxicity and mutation rate) would probably remain unchanged. Lastly, it is important to highlight the importance of the use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and offer safer options to farmworkers (e.g. organic farming or less toxic alternatives).\n",

            "Keywords: \"Dire Dawa\", \"healthcare-seeking\", \"knowledge\", \"neonatal danger signs\"\n",
            "Neonatal mortality is one of the challenging issues in current global health. Globally, about 2.5 million children die in the first month of life, out of which Sub-Saharan Africa accounts >40% per annual. Currently, the neonatal mortality rate in Ethiopia is 30/1000 live births. In the study area, there was a limitation of data on mothers' knowledge towards neonatal danger signs. Therefore, this study aimed to assess mothers' knowledge of neonatal danger signs and associated factors.\n",
            "A community-based cross-sectional design study was conducted in Dire Dawa from March 01/2019 to April 30/2019. Data were collected from 699 randomly selected mothers through a face-to-face interview. Bivariate logistic regression with p-value <0.25 was entered into the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Finally, AOR with 95% confidence intervals at P-value <0.05 was considered a significant association with the outcome variable.\n",
            "About 285 (40.8%) (95% CI: 37.3-44.3) of mothers had good knowledge of neonatal danger signs, and 97.1% (95% CI: 94.1, 99.3) of mothers sought medical care at a health facility. Mothers who were governmental employed (AOR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.17-3.9), whose fathers' educational level is secondary or above (AOR=2.3, 95% CI: 1.18-4.49), four/more antenatal care visit (AOR=4.3, 95% CI: 1.5-12.3), whose baby developed danger signs (AOR=3.5, 95% CI: 2.13-5.73), and those mothers received education on neonatal danger sign (AOR=7, 95% CI: 4.2-11.5), had a significant association with knowledge of neonatal danger signs.\n",
            "Maternal knowledge toward neonatal danger signs was low and a high number of mothers sought medical care at a health facility. Mother's occupation, fathers' education, development of neonatal danger signs, frequency of antenatal care visit, and received health education on neonatal danger signs were factors associated with mothers' knowledge towards neonatal danger signs.\n",

            "There is high risk of contamination with COVID-19 virus during routine dental procedures and infection control is crucial. The aim of this study was to determine the factors associated with Covid-19 preventive behaviors among oral health care providers using an extended parallel process model (EPPM).\n",
            "In a cross-sectional study, short text message invite surveys were sent to 870 oral health care providers in west part of Iran. Data were collected through validated self-report EPPM questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Fishers exact tests were used for data analysis.\n",
            "In total, 300 completed questionnaires were received and the mean age of respondents was 29.89 ± 11.17 years (range: 20-75 years). Among the study population, 284 (94.67%) perceived the threat of infection highly. Washing hands frequently with water and soap and use of hand sanitizer was reported by 93.33%, of participants. Age (P = 0.010), sex (P = 0.002) and occupation field (P = 0.010) were significantly associated with danger control responses. Data identified that those oral health care providers that were on the danger control response adopted preventive behaviors more strictly than those on fear control response.\n",
            "The results of this study showed how degrees of perceived threat and perceived efficacy influenced oral health providers' willingness to perform recommended health behaviors. These findings can assist public health agencies in developing educational programs specifically designed for promoting preventive behaviors among oral health providers in pandemic situations.\n",

            "While chickenpox is usually a mild and self-limiting disease, life-threatening complications can occur, particularly in risk groups such as pregnant women. In the case reported here, a 34-year-old woman, pregnant with her second child, was exposed to the varicella zoster virus (VZV) during the sixth week of pregnancy. Blood results showed seronegative status for VZV. Despite properly and well-timed administration of immunoglobulins, the patient developed chickenpox two weeks after exposure. Two days after developing symptoms she was admitted to the emergency room with fever and sudden shortness of breath. Radiological examination confirmed bilateral pneumonia, most probably due to VZV. Developing chickenpox during pregnancy is not only potentially dangerous for the unborn baby, but also for the mother. All medical specialists involved should be aware of the risks and consequences of this rare, yet dangerous, timing of chickenpox.\n",

            "Keywords: \"auditory warning\", \"lateral collision warning\", \"semi-autonomous driving\", \"stimulus–response compatibility\"\n",
            "The present study investigated the design of spatially oriented auditory collision-warning signals to facilitate drivers' responses to potential collisions.\n",
            "Prior studies on collision warnings have mostly focused on manual driving. It is necessary to examine the design of collision warnings for safe takeover actions in semi-autonomous driving.\n",
            "In a video-based semi-autonomous driving scenario, participants responded to pedestrians walking across the road, with a warning tone presented in either the avoidance direction or the collision direction. The time interval between the warning tone and the potential collision was also manipulated. In Experiment 1, pedestrians always started walking from one side of the road to the other side. In Experiment 2, pedestrians appeared in the middle of the road and walked toward either side of the road.\n",
            "In Experiment 1, drivers reacted to the pedestrian faster with collision-direction warnings than with avoidance-direction warnings. In Experiment 2, the difference between the two warning directions became nonsignificant. In both experiments, shorter time intervals to potential collisions resulted in faster reactions but did not influence the effect of warning direction.\n",
            "The collision-direction warnings were advantageous over the avoidance-direction warnings only when they occurred at the same lateral location as the pedestrian, indicating that this advantage was due to the capture of attention by the auditory warning signals.\n",
            "The present results indicate that drivers would benefit most when warnings occur at the side of potential collision objects rather than the direction of a desirable action during semi-autonomous driving.\n",

The present study compared the thickness of the dentinal wall in the danger zone (furcation area) of the first and second mesiobuccal canals in the maxillary first and second molars using cone beam computed tomography.\n",
            "In this cross-sectional study, 50 CBCT images of maxillary first and second molars were evaluated from one of the specialized radiology centers in Kerman, Iran. The images were prepared by a Planmeca Promax 3D Max machine (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland), with a field of view (FOV) of 8×8 cm and a resolution of 0.1 mm and analyzed with Romexis Viewer software version 3.1.1 (Planmeca, Helsinki, Finland). In the 0.1-mm-thick axial cross-sections with a distance of 1 mm, the distances from the center of the MB1 and MB2 root canals to the furcation area were measured in three areas: A) furcation area, B) 2 mm below the furcation area, and C) 4 mm below the furcation area (at a magnification of ×10). The data were then analyzed with paired t-test.\n",
            "The thickness of the dentinal wall in the MB2 root canal was significantly less than that in the MB1 root canal in all the specimens (P<0.05). In both maxillary first and second molars, the thicknesses of the MB1 and MB2 root canals were significantly different in the furcation area and 4 mm below the furcation area (P=0.001). There was no significant difference between the maxillary first and second molars 2 mm below the furcation area; however, the difference was marginal (P=0.07).\n",
            "Considering the low thickness of the dentinal wall in the MB2 root canal compared with the MB1 root canal in the maxillary first and second molars, the anti-curvature techniques away from the furcation should be used to prepare this root canal to reduce the risk of strip perforation. On the other hand, it might indicate that highly tapered instruments and other aggressive instruments, such as Gates-Glidden drills, should be used with caution in these root canals.\n",

Transplantation is one of the most affected sectors, as it relies on a variety of services that have been drastically occupied to treat patients affected by COVID-19. With this report from two transplant centers in Italy, we aim to reflect on resource organization, organ allocation, virus testing and transplant service provision during the course of the pandemic and to provide actionable information highlighting advantages and drawbacks.To what extent can we preserve the noble purpose of transplantation in times of increased danger? Strategies to minimize risk exposure to the transplant population and health- workers include systematic virus screening, protection devices, social distancing and reduction of patients visits to the transplant center. While resources for the transplant activity are inevitably reduced, new dilemmas arise to the transplant community: further optimization of time constraints during organ retrievals and implantation, less organs and blood products donated, limited space in the intensive care unit and the duty to maintain safety and outcomes.\n",

Experimental therapies were identified by searching ClinicalTrials.gov for 'COVID-19', '2019-nCoV', '2019 novel coronavirus' and 'SARS-CoV-2'. The last search was performed on 30 June 2020. Herbal medicines, blood-derived products and in vitro studies were excluded. We identified comorbidities by searching PubMed for the MeSH terms 'COVID-19', 'Comorbidity' and 'Epidemiological Factors'. Potential drug-drug interactions were evaluated according to known pharmacokinetics, overlapping toxicities and QT risk. Drug-drug interactions were graded GREEN and YELLOW: no clinically significant interaction; AMBER: caution; RED: serious risk. A total of 2378 records were retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov, which yielded 249 drugs that met inclusion criteria. Thirteen primary compounds were screened against 512 comedications. A full database of these interactions is available at www.covid19-druginteractions.org. Experimental therapies for COVID-19 present a risk of drug-drug interactions, with lopinavir/ritonavir (10% RED, 41% AMBER; mainly a perpetrator of pharmacokinetic interactions but also risk of QT prolongation particularly when given with concomitant drugs that can prolong QT), chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (both 7% RED and 27% AMBER, victims of some interactions due to metabolic profile but also perpetrators of QT prolongation) posing the greatest risk. With management, these risks can be mitigated. We have published a drug-drug interaction resource to facilitate medication review for the critically ill patient.\n",

            "Keywords: \"cardiac arrest\", \"pediatric airway management\", \"pop-off valve\", \"respiratory failure\"\n",
            "Most pediatric resuscitator bags are equipped with a positive-pressure relief (\"pop-off\") valve meant to prevent delivery of excessive pressure. Pop-off valves, however, can lead to adverse events in emergency situations when providers are unaware of their significance.\n",
            "A 3-year-old girl with muscular atrophy and a chronic tracheostomy tube was noted to have decreasing oxygen saturations. Paramedics found the patient in cardiac arrest and initiated resuscitative efforts; the patient regained pulses but quickly became pulseless again. There were two more cycles of cardiac arrest followed by return of spontaneous circulation. When she arrived at the emergency department pulses were present. The emergency physician performed bag ventilation and felt no resistance to bag squeezing, but saw no chest rise, and realized the patient was not being ventilated because all of the air was escaping through the pop-off valve. When the valve was closed, it was impossible to perform bag ventilation. She was found to have complete occlusion of her tracheostomy tube; the paramedics had not been ventilating during transport, though were unaware of the occlusion because of the open pop-off valve. Removal of the tracheostomy tube and placement of an endotracheal tube significantly improved ventilation. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Pop-off valves are common on pediatric resuscitator bags, but often result in insufficient ventilation and oxygenation during emergency airway management. Emergency airway experts recommend that pop-off valves be avoided or deactivated during emergency resuscitation, but this information has not been widely disseminated.\n",

            "The occupational hazards of health workers (HWs) in standard work environments have been well defined in both the developed and developing world during routine working conditions. Less defined are the hazards to HWs during pandemics, epidemics, natural disasters, wars, conflicts, and other crises. How do crises affect the infrastructure of medical systems? What are the distinct needs of the patient population during crises? What are the peculiarities of the Crisis Health Worker (CHW)? What are the known CHWs' occupational risks? What are the protective factors? By means of a PubMed search, we synthesized the most relevant publications to try to answer these questions. Failures of healthcare infrastructure and institutions include CHW shortages, insufficient medical supplies, medications, transportation, poorly paid health workers, security concerns, and the absence of firm guidance in health policy. Healthcare needs affecting the patient population and CHWs include crisis-induced injury and illness, hazardous exposures, communicable diseases, mental healthcare, and continuity of care for pre-crisis medical conditions. CHWs' occupational hazards include supply deficiencies, infectious disease transmission, long working hours, staff shortages, financial reimbursements, mental fatigue, physical exhaustion, and inconsistent access to clean water, electricity, and Internet. CHWs suffer from injuries and illnesses that range from immediate, debilitating injuries to chronic, unforeseen effects like mental fatigue, physical exhaustion, anxiety, burnout, and even post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD). Protective factors include personal traits such as adaptability and resilience as well as skills learned through structured education and training. Success will be achieved by constructively collaborating with local authorities, local health workers, national military, foreign military, and aid organizations.\n",

            "Keywords: \"CADASIL\", \"CGRP\", \"migraine\", \"patient safety\", \"stroke\"\n",
            "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is an inherited small vessel disease characterised by recurrent ischemic stroke, cognitive decline progressing to dementia, psychiatric disturbances and apathy. More than half of mutation carriers suffer from migraine, most often migraine with aura. Recently, a CADASIL patient was treated with a monoclonal antibody targeting the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the CGRP system have been demonstrated to be safe, well tolerated, and effective in reducing migraine attacks. There is, however, abundant evidence that CGRP is important in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis under (patho)physiological conditions. CGRP may act as a vasodilatory safeguard during cerebral and cardiac ischemia and blockage of the system could, therefore, potentially worsen ischemic events. Therefore, we caution against treating patients with small vessel diseases, such as the monogenic disorder CADASIL, with these drugs until relevant safety data and long term follow up results are available. Alternative preventive migraine treatments in CADASIL may be acetazolamide, sodium valproate, lamotrigine, topiramate, verapamil, or flunarizine.\n",

            "Forest fires are an integral part of the natural Earth system dynamics, however they are becoming more devastating and less predictable as anthropogenic climate change exacerbates their impacts. In order to advance fire science, fire danger reanalysis products can be used as proxy for fire weather observations with the advantage of being homogeneously distributed both in space and time. This manuscript describes a reanalysis dataset of fire danger indices based on the Canadian Fire Weather Index system and the ECMWF ERA5 reanalysis dataset, which supersedes the previous dataset based on ERA-Interim. The new fire danger reanalysis dataset provides a number of benefits compared to the one based on ERA-Interim: it relies on better estimates of precipitation, evaporation and soil moisture, it is available in a deterministic form as well as a probabilistic ensemble and it is characterised by a considerably higher spatial resolution. It is a valuable resource for forestry agencies and scientists in the field of wildfire danger modeling and beyond. The global dataset is produced by ECMWF, as the computational centre of the European Forest Fire information System (EFFIS) of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, and it is made available free of charge through the Climate Data Store.\n",

            "Keywords: \"ARDS\", \"HMGB1\", \"RAGE\", \"RIPK3\", \"acute lung injury\", \"necroptosis\", \"trali\", \"transfusion medicine\"\n",
            "RBC transfusion is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Endothelial cell necroptosis and subsequent damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release has been identified as a mechanism of injury following RBC transfusion. Mounting evidence implicates the pro-inflammatory pattern recognition receptor, Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Products (RAGE), in initiating cell death programmes such as necroptosis. Here, we demonstrate the role of RAGE in endothelial necroptosis, as deletion of RAGE attenuates necroptotic cell death in response to TNFα, LPS or CpG-DNA. We show direct interaction of RAGE with the critical mediator of necroptosis, Receptor Interacting Protein Kinase 3 (RIPK3), during necroptosis. Furthermore, we observe decreased plasma High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) and RIPK3 levels in RAGE deficient mice compared to WT mice post-transfusion, substantiating the role for RAGE in transfusion-induced DAMP release in vivo. Collectively, these findings underscore RAGE as an essential mediator of regulated necrosis and post-transfusion DAMP release. Further studies to understand the role of RAGE and the necroptotic pathway in transfusion-induced organ injury may offer key targets to mitigate transfusion-related risks, including the risk of ARDS, in susceptible hosts.\n",

            "The idea that cellular stress (including that precipitated by stretch), plays a significant role in the mechanisms initiating parturition, has gained considerable traction over the last decade. One key consequence of this cellular stress is the increased production of Danger Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMPs). This diverse family of molecules are known to initiate inflammation through their interaction with Pattern Recognition Receptors (PRRs) including, Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are the key innate immune system surveillance receptors that detect Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) during bacterial and viral infection. This is also seen during Chorioamnionitis. The activation of TLR commonly results in the activation of the pro-inflammatory transcription factor Nuclear Factor Kappa-B (NF-kB) and the downstream production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. It is thought that in the human fetal membranes both DAMPs and PAMPs are able, perhaps via their interaction with PRRs and the induction of their downstream inflammatory cascades, to lead to both tissue remodeling and weakening. Due to the high incidence of infection-driven Pre-Term Birth (PTB), including those that have preterm Premature Rupture of the Membranes (pPROM), the role of TLR in fetal membranes with Chorioamnionitis has been the subject of considerable study. Most of the work in this field has focused on the effect of PAMPs on whole pieces of fetal membrane and the resultant inflammatory cascade. This is important to understand, in order to develop novel prevention, detection, and therapeutic approaches, which aim to reduce the high number of mothers suffering from infection driven PTB, including those with pPROM. Studying the role of sterile inflammation driven by these endogenous ligands (DAMPs) activating PRRs system in the mesenchymal and epithelial cells in the amnion is important. These cells are key for the maintenance of the integrity and strength of the human fetal membranes. This review aims to (1) summarize the knowledge to date pertinent to the role of DAMPs and PRRs in fetal membrane weakening and (2) discuss the clinical potential brought by a better understanding of these pathways by pathway manipulation strategies.\n",

            "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a severe inflammatory response. Inflammation affects atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability and promotes a thrombogenic environment. We report a series of 6 patients with COVID-19 with acute ischemic stroke due to intraluminal carotid artery thrombus presenting during an 8-day period. Six patients were included (5 men) with a mean age of 65.8 years (range, 55-78 years). COVID-19 was diagnosed by detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 in 5 patients and was presumed due to typical clinical and imaging findings in 1 patient. All patients had vascular risk factors including diabetes (83%), hyperlipidemia (100%), and smoking (17%). Four patients presented with large infarcts with initial NIHSS scores of 24-30. During their hospitalization, all patients had elevated D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, 5 patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase and ferritin levels, 3 had elevated interleukin-6 levels, and 2 had elevated troponin levels. Inflammation related to COVID-19 may result in rupture of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, resulting in thrombosis and acute ischemic stroke.\n",

            "Keywords: \"COVID-19\", \"Humor\"\n",
            "Menstrual blood is not just a physical substance; it is laden with symbolism and often powerfully stigmatised. It is important to understand local perceptions and attitudes towards menstrual blood, as well as the preferred practices of menstruating women, in order to design appropriate sanitation and solid waste systems to support menstruation. Failure to take account of socio-cultural factors can jeopardise the effectiveness of such infrastructure. This study, conducted in Blantyre, Malawi, is a qualitative socio-cultural examination of how women manage and view menstruation. Thirty nine interviews, conducted with individuals and with small groups of friends, were carried out with thirty one women using pit latrines, flush toilets, and urine-diverting dry toilets in early 2019. Menstruation in Blantyre was found to be shrouded in secrecy because it was viewed as 'dirty', and therefore remained concealed. There was widespread anxiety about menstrual blood being used in ufiti (witchcraft), which affected how women used and disposed of their menstrual absorbents. At the same time, menstrual blood was also viewed as a powerful healing substance with uses in traditional medicine. The type of infrastructure required by women to support their menstruation depended on the type of menstrual absorbent used. Those using reusable cloth generally preferred a private bathroom with discreet drainage, whilst those using disposable pads needed a discreet and convenient disposal system. Increased preference for disposable pads over reusable cloth (particularly for younger women in education or employment) suggested that menstrual waste profiles of urban areas may be changing. Understanding these changing needs will be crucial for planning effective, sustainable waste disposal and sanitation infrastructure.\n",

Similarly, stimuli presented outside conscious awareness could influence social judgments of neutral novel stimuli. The two-fold aim of this study was: i) to evaluate whether observation of seen emotional faces could affect the judgment of social interactions without contextual cues (visible prime condition), and ii) whether this effect could also emerge when the emotional faces were made not visible by means of continuous flash suppression (invisible prime condition). We found that both seen and unseen faces are able to affect the judgment of ambiguous social interactions although this effect was particularly evident when affective faces were clearly visible. The present findings supported the idea that both conscious and unconscious processing of emotional faces have an important role in modulating perceivers' affective state and their judgment of social interactions.\n",

            "In emergencies, social coordination is especially challenging. People connected with each other may respond better or worse to an uncertain danger than isolated individuals. We performed experiments involving a novel scenario simulating an unpredictable situation faced by a group in which 2480 subjects in 108 groups had to both communicate information and decide whether to 'evacuate'. We manipulated the permissible sorts of interpersonal communication and varied group topology and size. Compared to groups of isolated individuals, we find that communication networks suppress necessary evacuations because of the spontaneous and diffuse emergence of false reassurance; yet, communication networks also restrain unnecessary evacuations in situations without disasters. At the individual level, subjects have thresholds for responding to social information that are sensitive to the negativity, but not the actual accuracy, of the signals being transmitted. Social networks can function poorly as pathways for inconvenient truths that people would rather ignore.\n",

A review on the available data from Guaratuba Bay, Southern Brazil, identifies six threats for conservation, other than those concerning the fishing effort on target resources. Differing from the popular view that fishing for pleasure could be innocuous for the environment, the identified threats concern both commercial and non-commercial fisheries: (1) catching of reproductive individuals; (2) catch of big old fat fecund females; (3) loss and abandonment of fishing gears; (4) use of natural baits; (5) bycatch of rays, turtles and non-target finfish; and (6) bad practices associated with catch-and-release or discarding. Environmental disturbances and fauna depletion are detected as potential impacts. Recommended actions for estuary conservation include fishing closures in mangrove and shallow waters areas, release of fish larger than the critical size, and measures against abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gears.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Antiviral drug\", \"Hepatitis B virus\", \"Liver transplant\", \"Minimization\", \"Prophylaxis\", \"Viral recurrence\"\n",
            "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) has been described more than 50 years ago. Similarly, to other clinical conditions, in which impairment of host immune defense favors viral replication, early reports described in details recurrence and reactivation of HBV in liver transplant recipients. The evidence of a possible, severe, clinical evolution of HBV reappearance in a significant percentage of these patients, allowed to consider, for some years, HBV positivity a contraindication for LT. Moving from the old to the new millennium this picture has changed dramatically. Several studies contributed to establish efficient prophylactic protocols for HBV recurrence and with the advent of more potent anti-viral drugs an increased control of infection was achieved in transplanted patients as well as in the general immune-competent HBV population. Success obtained in the last decade led some authors to the conclusion that HBV is now to consider just as a \"mere nuisance\". However, with regard to HBV and LT, outstanding issues are still on the table: (1) A standard HBV prophylaxis protocol after transplant has not yet been clearly defined; (2) The evidence of HBV resistant strains to the most potent antiviral agents is claiming for a new generation of drugs; and (3) The possibility of prophylaxis withdrawal in some patients has been demonstrated, but reliable methods for their selection are still lacking. The evolution of LT for HBV is examined in detail in this review together with the description of the strategies adopted to prevent HBV recurrence and their pros and cons.\n",

            "Treatment of a sunken appearance of the temporal region using injectable fillers is a popular procedure. The temporal fossa has very complex anatomy due to multiple vessels running in the different tissue layers. A severe complication in the form of non-thrombotic pulmonary embolism (NTPE) can occur as a result of an inadvertent injection in the middle temporal vein (MTV) while performing temporal fossa filler procedures. Therefore, in-depth knowledge and understanding of the MTV anatomy are essential for successful and safer injectable procedures of the temporal fossa.\n",
            "While there have been many studies to describe the arteries in this region, there is limited information about the location and course of the middle temporal vein. This literature review is aimed at providing detailed information about the course, depth, and size of the MTV to help aesthetic practitioners in performing safer temporal fossa filler injections. This information is imperative to delineate the 'venous danger zone' in the temple region.\n",
            "The preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines were used for this review. A literature search was performed to find the articles providing details about the MTV anatomy and the measurements related to its course and size.\n",
            "A review of the literature showed that the MTV displays a consistent course and depth in the temporal region, with high variability in its diameter. The middle temporal vein width varied between 0.5 and 9.1 mm in various studies. The middle temporal vein receives many subfascial tributaries from the surface of the temporalis muscle, and for most of its course runs in the fat pad enclosed between superficial and deep layers of the deep temporal fascia. A 'venous danger zone,' in the interfascial planes of the temporal fossa, which contain the main part of the MTV and its tributaries, has been proposed in this paper.\n",
            "The temporal fossa filler procedures need great caution, and knowledge of the depth and course of the MTV is essential for avoiding NTPE.\n",

            "Plants employ numerous cell-surface and intracellular immune receptors to perceive a variety of immunogenic signals associated with pathogen infection and subsequently activate defenses. Immune signaling is potentiated by the major defense hormone salicylic acid (SA), which reprograms the transcriptome for defense. Here we highlight recent advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying activation of the main classes of immune receptors, summarize the current understanding of their signaling mechanisms, and discuss an updated model for SA perception and signaling. In addition, we discuss how different receptors are organized into networks and the implications of such networks in the integration of complex danger signals for appropriate defense outputs.\n",

Here we report the known metabolic interactions that occur during infection of macrophages by intracellular bacteria and discuss the possible emergence of DAMMs upon bacteria-induced alterations of cellular metabolism.\n",

            "It has been demonstrated that perception of objects automatically evokes potential actions to interact with those objects; this is termed as affordance. The present study investigated how the corresponding affordance effect of graspable objects was modulated by the cue about risk levels of object. Participants were presented with pictures of dangerous graspable objects or neutral graspable objects. The participants were required to perform an upright/upside down discrimination task by pressing different keys. Results showed that both the affordance effects of dangerous object and neutral object in children were enhanced when a cue preceded the object, t(35) = 3.83, p < .01, Cohen's d = 1.29. These results indicate that the prompt of risk level can improve individual's appropriate manipulation to the object.\n",

            "Mycotoxins are low-molecular weight compounds produced mainly by fungi, with Fusarium and Aspergillus origin. Secondary, metabolites, are mostly found on plants. However, the contamination of the feed and forage has been also reported. Because of their pharmacological activity, mycotoxins can be used as chemical warfare agents, drugs or growth promotants. Additionally, mycotoxins are found as one of the most dangerous genotoxic factors which cause the damage of DNA and lead to disease development. This review includes the knowledge of mycotoxins as both, an invisible danger of forage and as food additives. Special emphasis shall be given on mycotoxins with proven cancerogenic activity; including aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes, and zearalenone. Factors such as species, mechanisms/modes of action, metabolism, and defense mechanisms were taken into account. The main concern was focused on zearalenone characterization, because of its estrogenic activity, caused by structural similarity to estrogens, naturally occurring in cells. By binding to estrogenic receptors, toxins are, accumulated in organisms and long-term exposure may cause the disturbances, especially in the reproductive system. The next part of this paper contains the description of main strategies of toxins determination. Finally, in the review, several potential methods for the dioxins neutralization were discussed.\n",

            "Reducing neonatal mortality is an essential part of the third Sustainable Development Goal, to end preventable child deaths. Neonatal danger signs are the most common cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. In Ethiopia, most babies are born at home or are discharged from the health institutions in the first 24 h, as a result enhancing women's knowledge towards neonatal danger signs and its complication might reduce neonatal morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the women knowledge towards neonatal danger signs in Ethiopia.\n",

            "Fourteen cross-sectional studies with a total of 6617 study participants were included for this study. The overall pooled prevalence of women's knowledge towards neonatal danger sign was 40.7% (95%CI, 25.72, 55.67). Having higher educational status of the women (AOR = 3.86, 95%CI: 2.3-6.5), having higher educational status of the husband (AOR = 4.57, 95%CI: 3.29-6.35), access to mass media (AOR = 1.69, 95%CI: 1.17-2.23), having antenatal care visits (AOR = 2.63, 95%CI: 1.13-4.67), having postnatal care follow up (AOR = 2.55, 95%CI; 1.72-3.79) and giving birth at health institutions (AOR = 2.51, 95%CI:1.68-3.74) were factors associated with knowledge of the women towards danger sign of the neonate.\n",
            "In this systematic review and meta-analysis the pooled prevalence of maternal knowledge towards neonatal danger sign was low. Educational status of the mother, educational status of the husband, access to mass media, antenatal care follow-up, postnatal care follow-up and place of delivery were factors associated with knowledge of the mother towards danger sign of the newborn. Promoting antenatal care, postnatal care follow-up and community-based health information dissemination about neonatal danger signs should be strengthened.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Danger signs\", \"Ethiopia\", \"Newborn\", \"Systematic review\"\n",
            "Due to their bacterial ancestry, many components of mitochondria share structural similarities with bacteria. Release of molecular danger signals from injured cell mitochondria (mitochondria-derived damage-associated molecular patterns, mito-DAMPs) triggers a potent inflammatory response, but their role in fibrosis is unknown. Using liver fibrosis resistant/susceptible mouse strain system, we demonstrate that mito-DAMPs released from injured hepatocyte mitochondria (with mtDNA as major active component) directly activate hepatic stellate cells, the fibrogenic cell in the liver, and drive liver scarring. The release of mito-DAMPs is controlled by efferocytosis of dying hepatocytes by phagocytic resident liver macrophages and infiltrating Gr-1(+) myeloid cells. Circulating mito-DAMPs are markedly increased in human patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and significant liver fibrosis. Our study identifies specific pathway driving liver fibrosis, with important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. Targeting mito-DAMP release from hepatocytes and/or modulating the phagocytic function of macrophages represents a promising antifibrotic strategy.\n",

Chronic release of these molecules can also promote inflammation in the context of liver disease. Herein, we provide a comprehensive summary of the role of damage-associated molecular patterns as danger signals in liver injury. We consider the role of reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species as inducers of damage-associated molecular patterns, as well as how specific damage-associated molecular patterns participate in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases such as alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis and liver cancer. In addition, we discuss the role of damage-associated molecular patterns in ischaemia reperfusion injury and liver transplantation and highlight current studies in which blockade of specific damage-associated molecular patterns has proven beneficial in humans and mice.\n",

            "Immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is currently broadly used in the treatment of different types of cancer. The treatment targeting programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death-ligand 1 axis is already approved by Food and Drug Administration for numerous cancers. These kinds of therapy brought spectacular results in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer where systemic therapy was ineffective. However, a wide range of applied therapies based on ICIs in the clinic have led to unexpected side effects, such as severe cardiotoxicity. It needs to be underlined that the molecular mechanism of myocarditis in response to ICIs is still not fully understood. Lack of sufficient knowledge, especially concerning the kind of risk factors increasing probability of myocarditis, poses currently a large clinical problem. Continuous cardiac monitoring of patients who undergo ICI treatment presents another problem as it is cost-ineffective for the healthcare system. Herein, we highlight the risks of use of anticancer therapy based on ICIs. We also stress that detailed monitoring of any event of cardiotoxicity following ICIs treatment should be carefully investigated and registered to give a global overview of the frequency of myocarditis occurrence. Moreover, we propose that the extension of molecular and systemic knowledge of etiology of myocarditis as a side effect, including the role of protein kinases, will be highly beneficial for the medical field. Last but not least, better understanding of mechanisms of cardiotoxicity induction will improve the safety of cancer patients and will help clinicians in prediction of unexpected side effect occurrence.\n",

            "In efforts to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, it is recommended that all pregnant women be counseled on signs of pregnancy related complications and neonatal illness. In resource limited settings, such counselling may be task-shifted to lay health workers. We conducted a community-based cross-sectional survey of community health workers/volunteers in North and East Kamagambo of the Rongo Sub- County of Migori County, Kenya, between January-April 2018. A survey tool was administered through face-to-face interviews to investigate the level of knowledge of obstetric and neonatal danger signs among community health workers in North Kamagambo after one year of participation in the Lwala program, as well as to evaluate baseline knowledge of community health volunteers in East Kamagambo at the beginning of Lwala's expansion and prior to their receiving training from Lwala. The North Kamagambo group identified more danger signs in each category. The percentage of participants with adequate knowledge in the pregnancy, postpartum, and neonatal categories was significantly higher in North Kamagambo than in East Kamagambo. Sixty percent of participants in North Kamagambo knew 3 or more danger signs in 3 or more categories, compared to 24% of participants in East Kamagambo. Location in North Kamagambo (OR 2.526, p=0.03) and a shorter time since most recent training (OR 2.291, p=0.025) were associated with increased knowledge. Our study revealed varying levels of knowledge among two populations of lay health workers. This study highlights the benefit of frequent trainings and placing greater emphasis on identified gaps in knowledge of the labor and postpartum periods.\n",

            "Ligand-based selectivity in signal transduction (biased signaling) is an emerging field of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) research and might allow the development of drugs with targeted activation profiles. Human formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) is a GPCR that detects potentially hazardous states characterized by the appearance of N-formylated peptides that originate from either bacteria or mitochondria during tissue destruction; however, the receptor also responds to several non-formylated agonists from various sources. We hypothesized that an additional layer of FPR signaling is encoded by biased agonism, thus allowing the discrimination of the source of threat. We resorted to the comparative analysis of FPR1 agonist-evoked responses across three prototypical GPCR signaling pathways, i.e., the inhibition of cAMP formation, receptor internalization, and ERK activation, and analyzed cellular responses elicited by several bacteria- and mitochondria-derived ligands. We also included the anti-inflammatory annexinA1 peptide Ac2-26 and two synthetic ligands, the W-peptide and the small molecule FPRA14. Compared to the endogenous agonists, the bacterial agonists displayed significantly higher potencies and efficacies. Selective pathway activation was not observed, as both groups were similarly biased towards the inhibition of cAMP formation. The general agonist bias in FPR1 signaling suggests a source-independent pathway selectivity for transmission of pro-inflammatory danger signaling.\n",

A sample of 363 participants was included to the study from September 2018 to February 2019 through systematic selection of every other eligible mother baby pair. Data were collected through face to face interview at time of discharge from NICU. Knowledge score of neonatal danger signs was computed by adding the total number of correct spontaneous responses to 9 key danger signs with a minimum score of 0 and maximum of 9 [0 when a mother named none of the key danger signs and 9 when the mother named all the signs]. Mothers who scored ≥3 points were considered to have good knowledge whereas those scoring less than 3 points had poor knowledge.\n",

            "Intense debate surrounds the use of low-carbohydrate, ketogenic diets for the promotion of weight loss and avoidance of cardiovascular disease. The rationale behind these diets is that they promote fat oxidation and minimize the addition of glucose to proteins in the formation of adducts that trigger inflammation. Although nutritional ketosis is widely assumed to be a safe metabolic condition, proper consideration has not been given to the fact that ketones are reactive toward proteins through the same mechanisms as glucose. Here, the case is made that ketone bodies are more potent than glucose in bringing about the protein modifications to which the harmful effects of glucose have been attributed. It is suggested, therefore, that attempts to minimize such protein modifications through nutritional ketosis are futile and may lead to adverse health outcomes.\n",

            "In order to break tumor resistance towards traditional treatments, we investigate the response of tumor and immune cells to a novel, cytokine-armed oncolytic adenovirus: Ad5/3-d24-E2F-hTNFa-IRES-hIL2 (also known as TILT-123 and OAd.TNFa-IL2). There are several pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that might mediate adenovirus-infection recognition. However, the role and specific effects of each PRR on the tumor microenvironment and treatment outcome remain unclear. Hence, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of OAd.TNFa-IL2 infection on PRR-mediated danger- and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (DAMP and PAMP, respectively) signaling. In addition, we wanted to see which PRRs mediate an antitumor response and are therefore relevant for optimizing this virotherapy. We determined that OAd.TNFa-IL2 induced DAMP and PAMP release and consequent tumor microenvironment modulation. We show that the AIM2 inflammasome is activated during OAd.TNFa-IL2 virotherapy, thus creating an immunostimulatory antitumor microenvironment.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Cephalopod\", \"Predatory cues recognition\", \"Prenatal learning\", \"Ventilation rate\"\n",
            "Predation can be a very strong selective pressure on prey. Many studies have shown the existence of innate anti-predator responses, mostly in the early developmental stages of juvenile vertebrates. Learning to recognize predators is another possible defensive resource, but such a method involves a high death risk. There is evidence that prenatal learning exists in animals but few studies have explicitly tested for embryonic learning. The aim of this study was to test innate and learned predator recognition in cuttlefish embryos. For this, naïve embryos were exposed to chemical and visual cues emanating from predators, non-predators, and ink. Their response was assessed by measuring their ventilation rate (VR). We first show that VR decreased in response to both visual and chemical predatory cues and ink but not to non-predatory cues. Second, we show that when non-predatory cues (visual or chemical) are paired with predatory cues or ink for several days, embryonic VR significantly decreased. Such a response is likely adaptive, especially in a translucent egg, since it results in reduced movement and hence may lower the risk of detection by visual predators. This freezing-like behavior may also reduce the bioelectric field, thus lessening the predation risk by non-visual foragers. Our results report that cuttlefish embryos had an innate capacity to differentiate between harmless and harmful chemical and visual cues. They were also capable of learning to respond to harmless cues when they were paired with danger (predator or ink) based on conditioning. The combination of these behavioral mechanisms is an example of the early adaptability of cephalopods. Such behavioral plasticity may give the newly hatched cuttlefish a selective advantage when dealing with either known or unfamiliar threats. Nevertheless, more experiments are needed to test the efficiency of the embryos' response faced with known or new predators.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Bayesian updating\", \"antipredator behavior\", \"fear\", \"predator-prey interactions\", \"risk assessment\", \"safety\"\n",
            "The ability of prey to assess predation risk is fundamental to their success. It is routinely assumed that predator cues do not vary in reliability across levels of predation risk. We propose that cues can differ in how precisely they indicate different levels of predation risk. What we call danger cues precisely indicate high risk levels, while safety cues precisely indicate low risk levels. Using optimality modeling, we find that prey fitness is increased when prey pay more attention to safety cues than to danger cues. This fitness advantage is greater when prey need to protect assets, predators are more dangerous, or predation risk increases at an accelerating rate with prey foraging efforts. Each of these conditions lead to prey foraging less when estimated predation risk is higher. Danger cues have less value than safety cues because they give precise information about risk when it is high, but prey behavior varies little when risk is high. Safety cues give precise information about levels of risk where prey behavior varies. These results highlight how our fascination with predators may have biased the way that we study predator-prey interactions and focused too exclusively on cues that clearly indicate the presence of predator rather than cues that clearly indicate their absence.\n",

            "Near real time (NRT) remote sensing derived land surface temperature (Ts) data has an utmost importance in various applications of natural hazards and disasters. Space-based instrument MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) acquired NRT data products of Ts are made available for the users by LANCE (Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability) for Earth Observing System (EOS) of NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) free of cost. Such Ts products are swath data with 5 min temporal increments of satellite acquisition, and the average latency is 60-125 min to be available in public domain. The swath data of Ts requires a specialized tool, i.e., HEG (HDF-EOS to GeoTIFF conversion tool) to process and make the data useful for further analysis. However, the file naming convention of the available swath data files in LANCE is not appropriate to download for an area of interest (AOI) to be processed by HEG. In this study, we developed a method/algorithm to overcome such issues in identifying the appropriate swath data files for an AOI that would be able to further processes supported by the HEG. In this case, we used Terra MODIS acquired NRT swath data of Ts, and further applied it to an existing framework of forecasting forest fires (as a case study) for the performance evaluation of our processed Ts. We were successful in selecting appropriate swath data files of Ts for our study area that was further processed by HEG, and finally were able to generate fire danger map in the existing forecasting model. Our proposed method/algorithm could be applied on any swath data product available in LANCE for any location in the world.\n",

This paper presents a novel Early Warning System (EWS) for locating and protecting potential victims of IPV in which the victims' environment plays a central role. Specifically, based on Markov random fields, our EWS measures the danger through the perception that the victims' surroundings have. This new standpoint is of particular relevance since most of the IPV victims do not have a clear perception of the approaching danger. The EWS has been designed without geographical constrains to be appropriate for use in every country of the world (universal EWS). Importantly, it may be rewritten into computational terms thereby providing a real tool for police investigations. Connections with text mining and sentiment analysis may provide additional devices based on this model.\n",

Two hundred and ten (210) (28.6%), 255 (34.7%) and 169 (23%) of respondents affirmed having experienced three or more obstetric danger signs during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, respectively. Urban residency [a danger sign associated with pregnancy (AOR=4.01, 95% CI=1.85-8.69), childbirth (AOR=2.47, 95% CI=1.12-5.43) and the postpartum period (AOR=3.39, 95% CI=1.60-7.18)]; having antenatal care follow-up in their last pregnancy [a danger sign associated with pregnancy (AOR=3.47, 95% CI=1.95-6.18), childbirth (AOR=2.36, 95%CI=1.41-3.96) and the postpartum period (AOR=2.48, 95% CI=1.49-4.13)]; and giving birth at a health institution (AOR=1.43, 95% CI=1.01-2.02) were significant factors.

            "Social cues of threat are widely reported [1-3], whether actively produced to trigger responses in others such as alarm calls or by-products of an encounter with a predator, like the defensive behaviors themselves such as escape flights [4-14]. Although the recognition of social alarm cues is often innate [15-17], in some instances it requires experience to trigger defensive responses [4, 7]. One mechanism proposed for how learning from self-experience contributes to social behavior is that of auto-conditioning, whereby subjects learn to associate their own behaviors with relevant trigger events. Through this process, the same behaviors, now displayed by others, gain meaning [18, 19] (but see [20]). Although it has been shown that only animals with prior experience with shock display observational freezing [21-25], suggesting that auto-conditioning could mediate this process, evidence for this hypothesis was lacking. Previously we found that, when a rat freezes, the silence that results from immobility triggers observational freezing in its cage-mate, provided the cage-mate had experienced shocks before [24]. Therefore, in our study, auto-conditioning would correspond to rats learning to associate shock with their own response to it-freezing. Using a combination of behavioral and optogenetic manipulations, here, we show that freezing becomes an alarm cue by a direct association with shock. Our work shows that auto-conditioning can indeed modulate social interactions, expanding the repertoire of cues mediating social information exchange, providing a framework to study how the neural circuits involved in the self-experience of defensive behaviors overlap with the ones involved in socially triggered defensive behaviors.\n",

            "Geminiviruses are DNA viruses that cause severe diseases in diverse species of plants, resulting in considerable agricultural losses worldwide. C4 proteins are a major symptom determinant in several geminiviruses, including Beet severe curly top virus (BSCTV). Here, we uncovered a novel mechanism by which danger peptide signaling enhances the internalization of BSCTV C4 in plant cells. Previous studies showed that this signaling is important for activation of bacterium- and fungus-triggered immune responses, but its function in plant-virus interactions was previously unknown. Pep1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) and PEPR2 are receptor kinases recognized by Peps (plant elicitor peptides) in the danger peptide pathway. We found that BSCTV C4 up-regulated and interacted with PEPR2 but not PEPR1. The Pep1-PEPR2 complex stimulated the internalization of C4 in both Arabidopsis and Nicotiana benthamiana cells. Furthermore, C4 induced callus formation in Arabidopsis, which was suppressed by PEPR2 overexpression but enhanced in the pepr2 mutants. In the presence of Pep1, overexpression of PEPR2 suppressed BSCTV infection in N. benthamiana. Exogenous Pep1 also reduced BSCTV infection in Arabidopsis in a PEPR2-dependent manner. Thus, PEPR2 recognizes the symptom determinant C4 and enhances its internalization mediated by danger peptides, suppressing BSCTV infection.\n",

            "A community based cross sectional study design was employed. All kebeles were included in study; the number of households was determined using proportionate-to-population size then systematic random sampling technique to select 422 women who gave birth in Shashamane town between April and May 2018. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data. Data was checked and entered into Epi data version 3.1 then exported to Statistical Package for Social Science version 23 for analysis. Univariate, bivariate and multivariable analysis with 95% CI was carried out. Women who spontaneously mentioned at least two danger signs of pregnancy from eight items were considered to have good knowledge of the obstetric danger signs.\n",
            "A total of 422 mothers were involved in the study. The mean age of the respondent was 25 with a standard deviation of 4.3 year. 59.5% of the respondents were found to have poor knowledge of obstetric danger signs. Majority of respondents mentioned vaginal bleeding (64.7%) as a danger sign of pregnancy. According to the result of the multivariable analysis, antenatal care was significantly associated with the knowledge of obstetric danger sign. Respondents who attended antenatal care were 1.26 times more likely to have good knowledge of obstetric danger signs than those who had no antenatal care [AOR = 1.26, 95%CI (1.08-1.85)]. Respondents who gave birth at health center were 3.57 time more likely to have good knowledge of obstetric danger signs than those who gave birth at home [AOR = 3.57, 95%CI (1.23-10.39)].\n",
            "According to this study, the knowledge of obstetric danger signs was poor. Some of the factors associated with this knowledge were antenatal care attendance and place of delivery; therefore, it is recommended that mothers should have at least four antenatal visits; this may create good relationship with the providers and enhance their knowledge. In addition to this providing compassionate and respectful maternity care in health facility is also crucial steps to attract more women to health facilities, and to reduce home deliveries.\n",

            "Trauma predisposes to systemic sterile inflammation (systemic inflammatory response syndrome) as well as infection, but the mechanisms linking injury to infection are poorly understood. Mitochondrial debris contains formyl peptides. These bind formyl peptide receptor-1, trafficking neutrophils to wounds, initiating systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and wound healing. Bacterial formyl peptides, however, also attract neutrophils via formyl peptide receptor-1. Thus, mitochondrial formyl peptides might suppress neutrophils antimicrobial function. Also, formyl peptide receptor-1 blockade used to mitigate systemic inflammatory response syndrome might predispose to sepsis. We examined how mitochondrial formyl peptides impact neutrophils functions contributing to antimicrobial responses and how formyl peptide receptor-1 antagonists affect those functions.\n",

The experiments were repeated using formyl peptide receptor-1 antagonist cyclosporin H, \"designer\" human formyl peptide receptor-1 antagonists (POL7178 and POL7200), or anti-formyl peptide receptor-1 antibodies. Mouse injury/lung infection model was used to evaluate effect of formyl peptide receptor-1 inhibition.\n",
            "Human neutrophils cytosolic calcium, chemotaxis, reactive oxygen species production, and phagocytosis were studied before and after exposure to mitochondrial debris, mitochondrial formyl peptides, and bacterial formyl peptides. Mitochondrial formyl peptide and bacterial formyl peptides had similar effects on neutrophils. Responses to chemokines and leukotrienes were suppressed by prior exposure to formyl peptides. POL7200 and POL7178 were specific antagonists of human formyl peptide receptor-1 and more effective than cyclosporin H or anti-formyl peptide receptor-1 antibodies. Formyl peptides inhibited mouse neutrophils responses to chemokines only if formyl peptide receptor-1 was present. Formyl peptide receptor-1 blockade did not inhibit neutrophils bacterial phagocytosis or reactive oxygen species production. Cyclosporin H increased bacterial clearance in lungs after injury.\n",

            "Renal arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are rare, with an incidence of approximately 0.04%. Diagnosis is often challenging due to mimics of AVMs. We report a case of renal AVM mimicking hydronephrosis on ultrasound and unenhanced computed tomography (CT). A 24-year-old female with background of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) presented to the Accident and Emergency department with 1 day history of bilateral flank pain, dysuria, rigors and pyrexia. Urine dipstick showed microscopic haematuria and blood tests showed mild neutrophilia. Dilated right renal pelvis was seen on ultrasound. Unenhanced CT of the urinary tract demonstrated right hydronephrosis with no evidence of calculi. Subsequent Uro-radiology meeting discussion concluded that renal pelvis might be pus-filled and recommended an urgent nephrostomy. However, ultrasound Doppler scan performed at the time of the planned nephrostomy demonstrated colour flow within dilated renal pelvis suggestive of an AVM. Nephrostomy was abandoned and subsequent CT angiogram confirmed a large congenital AVM. The patient was referred for embolization.Colour flow ultrasound imaging is a simple and quick technique to diagnose AVMs. However, as in our case, when colour flow Doppler imaging was not used at the initial ultrasound, the opportunity to obtain an accurate diagnosis was missed. If the subsequently planned nephrostomy had taken place, this may have led to potentially serious outcomes. We suggest that colour flow imaging should be used prior to nephrostomy insertion to differentiate hydronephrosis from vascular abnormalities.\n",

Understanding the three-dimensional architecture of the facial soft tissue, the fascial planes that exist within this architectural arrangement, and the danger zones where the facial nerve is situated superficial and adjacent to the planes of dissection commonly used in face-lift techniques, are the keys to safety in preventing motor branch injury. The two-dimensional branching patterns of the marginal and cervical branches of the facial nerve are variable, making it difficult to ascertain exact nerve location when dissecting within the cheek and neck. On a three-dimensional basis, the position and depth of the marginal and cervical branches are constant and predictable. Understanding the three-dimensional anatomy in terms of planes of dissection, and the danger zones where these nerve branches are vulnerable to injury, provides protection against iatrogenic injury when performing surgical rejuvenation of the aging face. These video vignettes provide an overview of the fascial anatomy of the cheek in relation to the facial nerve branches and delineate the regions of the face in which nerve branches are most likely to be injured. Methods to prevent injury are discussed. Furthermore, the vignette defines these danger zones and delineates methods to protect the nerve branches.\n",

            "This paper is written for non-specialists in mitochondrial biology to provide access to an important area of science that has broad implications for all people. The cell danger response (CDR) is a universal response to environmental threat or injury. Once triggered, healing cannot be completed until the choreographed stages of the CDR are returned to an updated state of readiness. Although the CDR is a cellular response, it has the power to change human thought and behavior, child development, physical fitness and resilience, fertility, and the susceptibility of entire populations to disease. Mitochondria regulate the CDR by monitoring and responding to the physical, chemical, and microbial conditions within and around the cell. In this way, mitochondria connect cellular health to environmental health. Over 7,000 chemicals are now made or imported to the US for industrial, agricultural, and personal care use in amounts ranging from 25,000 to over 1 million pounds each year, and plastic waste now exceeds 83 billion pounds/year. This chemical load creates a rising tide of manmade pollutants in the oceans, air, water, and food chain. Fewer than 5% of these chemicals have been tested for developmental toxicity. In the 1980s, 5-10% of children lived with a chronic illness. As of 2018, 40% of children, 50% of teens, 60% of adults under age 65, and 90% of adults over 65 live with a chronic illness. Several studies now report the presence of dozens to hundreds of manmade chemicals and pollutants in placenta, umbilical cord blood, and newborn blood spots. New methods in metabolomics and exposomics allow scientists to measure thousands of chemicals in blood, air, water, soil, and the food chain. Systematic measurements of environmental chemicals can now be correlated with annual and regional patterns of childhood illness. These data can be used to prepare a prioritized list of molecules for congressional action, ranked according to their impact on human health.\n",

            "In the multilevel modelling literature, methodologists widely acknowledge that a level-1 variable can have distinct within-cluster and between-cluster effects, and that failing to disaggregate these can yield a slope estimate that is an uninterpretable, conflated blend of the two. Methodologists have stated, however, that including conflated slopes of level-1 variables in a model is not problematic if substantive interest lies only in effects of level-2 predictors. Researchers commonly follow this advice and use methods that do not disaggregate effects of level-1 control variables (e.g., grand mean centering) when examining effects of level-2 predictors. The primary purpose of this paper is to show that this is a dangerous practice. When level-specific effects of level-1 variables differ, failing to disaggregate them can severely bias estimation of level-2 predictor slopes. We show mathematically why this is the case and highlight factors that can exacerbate such bias. We corroborate these findings with simulations and present an empirical example, showing how such distortions can severely alter substantive conclusions. We ultimately recommend that simply including the cluster mean of the level-1 variable as a control will alleviate the problem.\n",

            "Unacceptably high maternal and perinatal mortality remain a major challenge in many low income countries. Early detection and management of danger signs through improved access to maternal services is highly needed for better maternal and infant outcomes. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of an interactive mobile messaging alert system on improving knowledge on danger signs, birth preparedness and complication readiness practices among pregnant women in Dodoma region, Tanzania.\n",
            "A controlled quasi experimental study of 450 randomly selected pregnant women attending antenatal care was carried in Dodoma municipal. Participants were recruited at less than 20 weeks of gestation during the first visit where 150 were assigned to the intervention and 300 to the control group. The intervention groups was enrolled in an interactive mobile messaging system and received health education messages and were also able to send and receive individualized responses on a need basis. The control group continued receiving usual antenatal care services offered at the ANC centers. Pregnant women were followed from their initial visit to the point of delivery. Level of knowledge on danger signs and birth preparedness were assessed at baseline and a post test was again given after delivery for both groups. Analyses of covariance, linear regression were employed to test the effectiveness of the intervention.\n",

There was significant mean scores differences for both knowleadge and birth preparedness between the intervention and the control group after the intervention (p < .001). The mean knowleadge score was (M = 9.531,SD = 2.666 in the intervention compared to M = 6.518,SD = 4.304 in the control, equivalent to an effect size of 85% of the intervention. Meanwhile, the mean score for IBPACR was M = 4.165,SD = 1.365 for the intervention compared to M = 2.631,SD = 1.775 in the control group with an effect size of 90% A multivariate linear regression showed a positive association between the intervention (p < 0.001) and level of knowledge (B = 2.910,95%CI = 2.199-3.621) and birth preparediness (B = 1.463,95%CI = 1.185-1.740).\n",

            "Social transmission of freezing behavior has been conceived of as a one-way phenomenon in which an observer \"catches\" the fear of another. Here, we use a paradigm in which an observer rat witnesses another rat receiving electroshocks. Bayesian model comparison and Granger causality show that rats exchange information about danger in both directions: how the observer reacts to the demonstrator's distress also influences how the demonstrator responds to the danger. This was true to a similar extent across highly familiar and entirely unfamiliar rats but is stronger in animals preexposed to shocks. Injecting muscimol in the anterior cingulate of observers reduced freezing in the observers and in the demonstrators receiving the shocks. Using simulations, we support the notion that the coupling of freezing across rats could be selected for to more efficiently detect dangers in a group, in a way similar to cross-species eavesdropping.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Malnutrition\", \"Nutritional status\", \"Obesity\", \"Postoperative monitoring\", \"Sleeve gastrectomy\"\n",
            "Obesity is a chronic life-threatening disease, and bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment in those patients. The two main operations are laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). LSG carries a smaller risk for nutritional deficiencies, while gastric bypass procedures are associated with increased nutritional deficiencies because the procedure is more complex and changes the gastrointestinal anatomy. Recent studies comparing LSG and RYGB have proven that these types of operation may lead to a similar weight reduction effect but cause different micronutrient deficiencies. Types of malnutrition after bariatric surgery include protein-energy malnutrition and deficiencies of micronutrients, such as iron, folate, vitamin A, and vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. Bariatric patients who do not adhere to the recommended diets are at a greater risk of developing relevant malnutrition. Therefore, life-long postoperative clinical and laboratory monitoring is necessary to diagnose deficiencies of vitamins, trace elements, and minerals and to correct them with supplements. Unfortunately, no standardized aftercare regimes exist for these patients, and the costs for nutritional supplements are paid by the patients themselves.\n",

            "Keywords: \"corticosteroids\", \"immunocompromise\", \"pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (pjp)\"\n",
            "Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP), historically regarded as an AIDS-defining illness, has been increasingly reported in non-HIV patients due to a myriad of risk factors resulting in immunosuppression. One of the more salient risk factors is corticosteroid use, including both low and high doses in prolonged, short-course, and intermittent-course regimens. The stance on PJP prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for non-HIV patients on corticosteroids alone (e.g., for inflammatory conditions) is unclear, with no official guidelines classifying patients by dosage, length of treatment, or preexisting conditions. Additionally, clinicians often prescribe significant dosages of corticosteroids without proper consideration of the immunosuppressive risk. Here, we describe a case of a non-HIV patient with suspected dermatomyositis who was initially prescribed prednisone 15 mg daily with no prophylaxis for one month, then increased prednisone 80 mg daily with added TMP-SMX prophylaxis. Three days following increase, the patient developed significant PJP-associated pneumomediastinum and expired within one week despite mechanical ventilation and aggressive TMP-SMX treatment. This deterioration within days following corticosteroid increase with appropriately prescribed prophylaxis is an unusual presentation of PJP pneumonia and emphasizes the fulminant progression of the disease. The unnecessary over-prescription of steroids in unconfirmed autoimmune conditions has led to an unfortunate increase in devastating infections such as PJP. Clinicians should maintain high clinical suspicion concerning the development of PJP pneumonia in corticosteroid patients as well as consider prophylaxis even before a significant steroid dose increase is prescribed.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Boko Haram\", \"Sexuality\", \"gender\", \"internally displaced women\", \"sexualisation\"\n",
            "Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights are fundamental human rights. Previous studies on gender and sexuality in displacement settings have often focused on sexual and gender-based violence and the reproductive health problems of women while underplaying their needs for sexual expression, pleasure and procreation. This paper examines the influence of conflict and displacement on gender relations, sexuality and natality of internally displaced women in Nigeria. It draws on data from a larger study in which focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were used to explore 52 women's gendered experiences with Boko Haram insurgency and displacement. A critical thematic analysis of data revealed that the women's relationships with their men were complex and ambiguous, characterised by both tensions and solidarity. The women saw their men as partners in their struggle against multi-level oppression, including the structural barriers that undermine their mutual sexual expressions and pleasure, as well as their desire to procreate and repopulate their decimated ancestral communities. We recommend collaborative efforts to promote and protect the Sexual and Reproductive Health Rights of displaced women which includes building physical structures and living conditions that promote healthy, safe and pleasurable sexual expressions, and socio-political structures that create access to the long term social security.\n",

            "Recent housing welfare reform in Britain has left many younger welfare claimants with no choice but to move into a shared rental property with strangers. In this paper we take an intersectional approach to analyzing the impact of housing welfare reform, by examining how certain protected equalities groups may be particularly at risk from the potential harms of shared living with strangers. Drawing upon in-depth biographical interview data, we outline how young people often spoke of their share houses as places that were detrimental to their health and wellbeing. Our analysis focuses on two key themes: physical safety and violence, followed by mental health and isolation. Ultimately the paper examines whether housing welfare reform in Britain has resulted in placing already vulnerable people into potentially dangerous and unhealthy housing situations.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Home\", \"Inequality\", \"Intersectionality\", \"Mental health\", \"Welfare\"\n",
            "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a high grade primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma and is among the most aggressive cutaneous malignancies. The rising incidence of MCC, together with its often rapidly aggressive course, underscore a critical need to recognize the histopathologic and the immunohistochemical features that inform its accurate diagnosis. In the current review, we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the accurate diagnosis of MCC and the exclusion of other entities in the differential diagnosis. We provide a comprehensive review of genomic studies that identified the molecular-genetic drivers of MCC as well as a summary of studies identifying prognostic biomarkers that can facilitate risk stratification. Importantly, Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) appears to be causative in most cases of MCC and represents both a diagnostic and prognostic marker. Finally, as staging of MCC has undergone critical refinements with the introduction of the 8th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, we provide an update on MCC staging. In particular, the prognostic significance of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in MCC necessitates a systematic approach to its evaluation and diagnosis to ensure accurate and consistent risk stratification for patients, and we therefore provide a comprehensive overview of SLN evaluation in MCC. Finally, the intimate relationship between MCC and the integrity of the host immune system has led to paradigm-shifting therapeutic advances with the successful application of immune checkpoint blockade to treat patients with advanced disease, and we therefore summarize those studies and the correlative studies in which predictive biomarkers have been identified.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Nonpowder weapons\", \"Pediatric\", \"Trauma\"\n",
            "Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common age-related chronic and disabling joint disease. Long considered to be a \"wear and tear\" disease, OA is now seen as a low-grade inflammation disease that affects all tissues of the joint, involving cartilage degradation, bone remodelling, osteophytes, and synovitis. The process, called inflammaging, is characterised by the association of low-grade inflammation, profound changes in intra-cellular mechanisms, and the decreased efficiency of the immune system with ageing. The activation of innate immunity plays a critical role in the development and progression of OA. Innate immunity, including inflammasome activation, is triggered by small endogenous molecules called alarmins or damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These molecules are released in the extracellular media after cell stress or damage, bind to pathogen-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and activate the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors, leading to joint inflammation. Moreover, such sterile inflammation triggers cell senescence, characterised by a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Understanding the substantial age-related changes of joint tissues that influence the pathogenesis of OA is critical to improving the quality of life of elderly people in the context of increased life expectancy. This review will focus on age-related sterile inflammation in OA and highlight the various innovative and promising therapies targeting the mechanisms of aging.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Antipredator response\", \"Behavior\", \"Neurotoxicity\", \"Olfaction\", \"Pesticides\", \"Zebrafish\"\n",
            "Fish are warned about the presence of predators via an alarm cue released from the skin of injured conspecifics. The detection of this odor inherently initiates an antipredator response, which increases the chance of survival for the individual. In the present study, we assessed the effect of three commonly used pesticides on the antipredator response of zebrafish (Danio rerio). For this, we analyzed the behavioral response of zebrafish to a conspecific skin extract following 24 h of exposure to the respective contaminants. Results demonstrate that fish exposed to 20 μg/L of the organophosphate insecticide chlorpyrifos significantly reduced bottom-dwelling and freezing behavior, suggesting an impairment of the antipredator response. For the urea-herbicide linuron and the pyrethroid insecticide permethrin, no statistically significant effects could be detected. However, linuron-exposed fish appeared to respond in an altered manner to the skin extract; some individuals failed to perform the inherent behaviors such as erratic movements and instead merely increased their velocity. Furthermore, we determined whether zebrafish would avoid the pesticides in a choice maze. While fish avoided permethrin, they behaved indifferently to chlorpyrifos and linuron. The study demonstrates that pesticides may alter the olfactory-mediated antipredator response of zebrafish in distinct ways, revealing that particularly fish exposed to chlorpyrifos may be more prone to predation.\n",

            "The most severe side effect in haemophilia A treatment is the development of antifactor VIII antibodies, also called inhibitors. Why inhibitors develop in a proportion of treated patients while others are unaffected still remains unanswered. The presence of immunological danger signals, associated with events such as infection or surgery, has been proposed to play a role. Previous studies demonstrated that the presence of the bacterial molecule lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can synergistically increase the activation of human DC and subsequent T cell activation by FVIII.\n",
            "In the present study, we investigated whether a combination of two danger signals can further increase immune cell activation by FVIII. For this, human in vitro differentiated DC that were treated with combinations of danger signals were co-cultured with autologous primary T cells, and T cell proliferation was analysed.\n",
            "Interestingly, by combining LPS with a second danger signal, lower LPS concentrations were sufficient to synergistically increase DC and subsequent T cell activation by FVIII. Of note, a combination of LPS and the double-stranded RNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), was most potent in increasing FVIII immunogenicity, followed by LPS + R848 (resiquimod). However, a combination of LPS and the bacterial lipopeptide Pam3CysSK4 did not induce increased immune cell activation by FVIII.\n",

            "Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) can subdue inflammation. In mice with acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), donor MDSC infusion enhances survival that is only partial and transient because of MDSC inflammasome activation early posttransfer, resulting in differentiation and loss of suppressor function. Here we demonstrate that conditioning regimen-induced adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release is a primary driver of MDSC dysfunction through ATP receptor (P2x7R) engagement and NLR pyrin family domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. P2x7R or NLRP3 knockout (KO) donor MDSCs provided significantly higher survival than wild-type (WT) MDSCs. Although in vivo pharmacologic targeting of NLRP3 or P2x7R promoted recipient survival, indicating in vivo biologic effects, no synergistic survival advantage was seen when combined with MDSCs. Because activated inflammasomes release mature interleukin-1β (IL-1β), we expected that IL-1β KO donor MDSCs would be superior in subverting GVHD, but such MDSCs proved inferior relative to WT. IL-1β release and IL-1 receptor expression was required for optimal MDSC function, and exogenous IL-1β added to suppression assays that included MDSCs increased suppressor potency. These data indicate that prolonged systemic NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition and decreased IL-1β could diminish survival in GVHD. However, loss of inflammasome activation and IL-1β release restricted to MDSCs rather than systemic inhibition allowed non-MDSC IL-1β signaling, improving survival. Extracellular ATP catalysis with peritransplant apyrase administered into the peritoneum, the ATP release site, synergized with WT MDSCs, as did regulatory T-cell infusion, which we showed reduced but did not eliminate MDSC inflammasome activation, as assessed with a novel inflammasome reporter strain. These findings will inform future clinical using MDSCs to decrease alloresponses in inflammatory environments.\n",

            "The first 28 days of life (the neonatal period) constitute the most vulnerable time for a child's survival. Overall 2.7 million neonatal deaths were stated by the 2015 global report of neonatal mortality and they account for 45% of under-five deaths. Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest risk of death in the first month of life and is among the regions showing the least progress in reducing neonatal mortality in the world. Ethiopia, as part of sub-Saharan Africa, also shares the greatest risk of neonatal death. A recent report in Ethiopia showed that neonatal mortality was 29 deaths per 1,000 live births. Therefore, the signs that suggest the onset of severe illness which leads to death and their contributing factors should be identified. The aim of the study was to assess knowledge about neonatal danger signs and associated factors among mothers attending immunization clinic at Arba Minch General Hospital.\n",
            "Institution-based cross-sectional study design was employed from Feb to April 2018. Systematic sampling technique was used to select a total of 345 mother-child pairs. A pretested, structured, and interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Data were entered using Epidata version 3.1 and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Bivariate and multivariable analysis were carried out using binary logistic regression to check and test the association between dependent and explanatory variables. Model fitness was checked by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test.\n",
            "Nearly two-fifths (40.9%) of all mothers had good knowledge about neonatal danger signs (95% CI; 35.7, 46.4). Close to thirty-three percent of mothers identified child's body hotness (fever) as a neonatal danger sign. Maternal educational status (AOR: 5.64; 95% CI: 1.68, 18.95) and attendance of postnatal care (AOR: 2.64; 95% CI: 1.36, 5.15) were significantly associated with maternal knowledge about neonatal danger signs in multivariable analysis.\n",
            "Even though considerable improvement has been achieved over the past decades as a result of expanded coverage of maternal and childcare services, still there are a significant number of mothers who have limited knowledge about neonatal danger signs. Therefore, interventional strategies that stress strengthening maternal education and ANC follow-up should be extended.\n",

            "Neonatal mortality has remained high in Ethiopia inspite of different efforts being undertaken to reduce this negative trend. Early detection of neonatal illnesses has an important step towards improving newborn survival. Toward this end, there is a need for postpartum mothers to be able to identify signs in neonates that signifies severe neonatal illnesses. There is limited information about the knowledge of post-partum mothers on NDSs and associated factors in the study area. This study aims to assess knowledge of NDSs, care-seeking practice and associated factors among postpartum mothers in Ambo town, Ethiopia, 2018. A systematic random sampling was employed to select respondents and data was collected through face-to-face interviews. Both bivariate and multivariable logistic regressions were utilized.\n",
            "One-fifth 82 (20.3%) of postpartum mothers have good knowledge about NDSs. Only 60.5% of mothers whom their baby developed danger-sign sought medical care for their baby from health facility immediately. Mothers who have diploma/more education (AOR = 5.25, CI 1.48-18.59), whose current baby developed danger-signs (AOR = 3.18 CI 1.06-9.52), having PNC follow-up (AOR = 2.29, CI 1.24-4.24) and receiving counseling on newborn care after delivery (AOR = 1.78, CI 1.04-3.04) were factors associated with having good knowledge on NDSs. In this study the level of postpartum mother's knowledge on NDSs and care-seeking practice were low.\n",

This article presents 3 clinical vignettes and recommendations resulting from a recent conference in Colorado on this important topic. In essence, the article seeks to address ways psychotherapists can balance the ethical challenges of simultaneously protecting clients and themselves. Each vignette is considered from ethical, clinical, and legal perspectives. Suggestions for the individual practitioner include reference to the principles and standards in the American Psychological Association's Ethics Code, professional consultation, and an increased emphasis on self-care. Recommendations for the profession involve ideas for the American Psychological Association's Ethics Code Task Force as well as a call for further research.

            "Keywords: \"Biglycan\", \"Hyaluronan\", \"Inflammation\", \"Toll-like receptor\", \"Versican\"\n",
            "The tumor matrix together with inflammation and autophagy are crucial regulators of cancer development. Embedded in the tumor stroma are numerous proteoglycans which, in their soluble form, act as danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). By interacting with innate immune receptors, the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), DAMPs autonomously trigger aseptic inflammation and can regulate autophagy. Biglycan, a known danger proteoglycan, can regulate the cross-talk between inflammation and autophagy by evoking a switch between pro-inflammatory CD14 and pro-autophagic CD44 co-receptors for TLRs. Thus, these novel mechanistic insights provide some explanation for the plethora of reports indicating that the same matrix-derived DAMP acts either as a promoter or suppressor of tumor growth. In this review we will summarize and critically discuss the role of the matrix-derived DAMPs biglycan, hyaluronan, and versican in regulating the TLR-, CD14- and CD44-signaling dialogue between inflammation and autophagy with particular emphasis on cancer development.\n",

            "The plant innate immune system has two major branches, the pathogen-triggered immunity and the effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The effectors are molecules released by plant attackers to evade host immunity. In addition to the foreign intruders, plants possess endogenous instigators produced in response to general cellular injury termed as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). In plants, DAMPs or alarmins are released by damaged, stressed, or dying cells following abiotic stress such as radiation, oxidative and drought stresses. In turn, a cascade of downstream signaling events is initiated leading to the upregulation of defense or response-related genes. In the present study, we have investigated more thoroughly the conservation status of the molecular mechanisms implicated in the danger signaling primarily in plants. Towards this direction, we have performed \n",

            "Late one spring night in 1986, around 1:30 a.m., the residents of Pripyat, a Ukrainian city of 50,000 people at the northern tip of the Dnieper River, were shaken from sleep by a giant explosion originating in the nuclear reactor of the nearby power plant in Chernobyl. It was an event that would forever change the course of their lives, and that of human history. Hundreds of people died, both directly and indirectly from the explosion, which is now regarded as the worst nuclear power plant catastrophe in history. Today, the Chernobyl power plant and Pripyat are completely abandoned, unsafe due to nuclear contamination. Within a 19-mile radius in every direction of the plant, the landscape is considered unfit for human life for the next 50,000 years. And the cause? Well, when the dust settled, it was a simple condition we all suffer from time to time: an error caused by a worker with too little sleep.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Pediatrics\", \"case reports\", \"tobacco abuse\"\n",
            "American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are the only racial group in the United States that is identified as having a higher risk for developing influenza-related complications. As such, influenza-related mortality has consistently been one of the leading causes of death among AI/ANs. In addition, estimating influenza-related mortality is hampered by significant degrees of racial misclassification and underreporting of both morbidity and mortality data in the AI/AN population. Using data available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we analyzed influenza mortality by geography, race, gender, and age group to improve our understanding of the influenza burden on AI/AN communities. We found that while mortality rates generally declined across the AI/AN population, significant disparities exist between AI/ANs and non-Hispanic whites (NHWs). The greatest disparities occurred at the earliest stages of life, with mortality rates for AI/AN children younger than 5 years being more than 2 times higher than for NHW children. Similarly, the burden of influenza-related mortality among AI/AN adults emerged much earlier in life compared with NHWs. Perhaps most important, though, we found significant disparities in the geographic distribution of influenza-related mortality among AI/ANs. Because these are largely vaccine-preventable deaths, these results identify an area for targeted intervention to reduce the overall deaths attributable to influenza.\n",

            "Keywords: \"Pediatrics\", \"case reports\", \"tobacco abuse\"\n",
            "In our previous work (Gomes, Soares, Silva, & Silva, 2018), we evidenced that snakes (vs. birds), an archetypal threat-related stimulus, have an advantage in accessing visual awareness during continuous flash suppression. This advantage was observed when the images were filtered in low spatial frequency (LSF) but not in high spatial frequency and interpreted as supporting the role of a subcortical pathway (superior colliculus-pulvinar) to the amygdala in threat detection, thought to be sensitive to LSF but not to high spatial frequency information. Recently Gayet, Stein, and Peelen (2019), using stimuli without differences in the threat they represented (bicycles and cars) but with an analogous perimeter-area ratio as snakes and birds (respectively), evidenced that bicycles had a faster access to visual awareness than cars. As in our study, this advantage relied on LSF information. The authors argued that the images' perimeter-area ratio (a characteristic intrinsically related with stimuli shape referred to by the authors as threat-unrelated properties), but not the threat itself, may have driven the detection advantage observed in our study and the association with the action of the subcortical pathway to the amygdala. We propose that the results obtained by Gayet et al. do not undermine ours and discuss the relevance of higher perimeter-area ratios (such as images with elongated shapes; e.g., snakes) as a threat-related property required for a fast-initial snake processing. We argue that stimuli shape is a prime feature for the fast-initial threat processing, relevant to grab early visual attention, an effect that might explain the obtained results.

Responding murine B cells were phenotyped using surface markers. RNA-Seq analysis was performed on murine CD19+ cells.

Intraoperatively, nearly fatal bleeding occurs due to a partial release of the carotid patch and needs to be managed immediately.\n",
            "The primarily pre-operated neck remains challenging for the radiologist in terms of differentiating between chronic lymphadenitis and metastasis. Furthermore, it remains challenging for the oncological surgeon in case these entities are in the near proximity of the previously operated carotid artery. The operative treatment according to the guidelines can lead to major bleeding during the second surgery. During the diagnostic process, metastases and chronic lymphadenitis after alloplastic carotid operations must be differentiated remaining however difficult, due to only scarce data in the literature.\n",
            "In the case of previous neck surgery, the decision to operate must be chosen individually regarding the specific conditions and their sometimes vital risks. In case an operation is indicated, the team must be trained to treat life-threatening intraoperative bleeding. In reviewing the literature, we were unable to find published recommendations on how to tackle these challenges.\n",
